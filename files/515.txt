(317) Similarly when the memory of "I am body" is gone and only the reality that "I am Brahman"
remains, what else than the Reality can be there?
(318) As he is in the body, but is with this very high level of realization, he is called by me as
Beyond Qualities.
(319) At this explanatory teaching, Partha was very happy like a peacock at the call of the cloud.

Arjuna asked - "O Lord, with what qualifications and signs does a man become one beyond the
qualities? And by what actions and how does he go beyond these three qualities? (21)
(320) With that satisfaction the brave Arjuna asked- "O Lord, what are the signs seen in such a man
who has such self-knowledge?
(321) Please be kind to tell me how he maintains his state of freedom from the qualities, and how he
discards the effect of the qualities.
(322) Upon this question of Arjuna, Shrikrishna, the king of sixfold glory, said to Arjuna in order to
solve his question-
(323,324) He said "O Partha, you are a wonderful man. How are you asking this question? The name
Gunateeta (Beyond qualities) is really an incorrect name. You are asking about how that man
does all activities; but since he has no relationship with all that happens in the body, and if you
presume that he has something to do, does it not prove his name as "Beyond Qualities" an
incorrect name? He who is called like this, does not get involved in them, and even if he is living
with the qualities around him, he is not caught in them.
(325) Now, you may have doubt, how he is not caught by the qualities if he is actually functioning
surrounded by all the upheavals of those qualities.
(326) If so, you may freely put that question to me and now listen how we will reply.
