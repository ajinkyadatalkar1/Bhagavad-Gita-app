said.
(102) "Dear Arjuna, the energy of action which is the beloved of the vital breath is always coming
and going through these organs."
(103) The Lord said, "Thus I have told you about the ten organs. Now please listen further in details,
about the mind.
(104) This mind functions at the junction of sense organs on one side and the intellect on the other
side, by overriding the Rajas quality.
(105) That which is only superficially apparent like the blue colour of the sky or the mirage
produced by sunrays, is the mind. It is like the dazzling quality added to the wind.
(106) When by the coming together of semen and the blood, the human body is formed, the air or the
wind in that body is divided into ten parts.
(107) These ten types of the wind occupy various ten places in the body by developing their separate
qualities.
(108) But all these ten are moving extremely fast and as they are thus unsteady, there is
predominance of the Rajas quality in them.
(109) This quickness of movement is outside the field of intellect, but superior enough to direct the
ego towards actions. Thus the mind is more forceful in the place between the ego and the intellect
which decides the type of experiences.
(110) This force is given the name of mind, but really it is only an image conceived by fanciful
concept, by whose attachment, Brahman is undervalued as Jeeva.
(111) It is the root of great Maya, it gives more strength to desire and it always keeps provoking the
ego.
(112) It fulfils the wishes but strengthens the hope and nourishes fear.
(113) It awakens duality, gives more power to ignorance and pushes the organs into the enjoyment of
pleasurable things.
(114) It creates the universe sheerly by imagination and destroys what it has created; and it
constructs towers of fanciful projections and topples them down.
(115) It is the deep storehouse of delusion; it is the core of the element of the wind and it closes the
door of intellect.
