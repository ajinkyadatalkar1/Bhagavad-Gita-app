(196) When a man loses the taste of food to such an extent that he does not even like to take nectar,
then we should know that his death is imminent.
(197) Similarly he, who is enjoying the pleasures of sense-objects and has lost any taste for
knowledge, is taken over by doubt. There is no mistake about it.
(198) Then, if he falls into doubt, you should definitely know him to be lost and deprived of
happiness in both this world and the other world.
(199) He who is in a moribund stage due to fever, does not sense hot or cold, and does not feel the
difference between the fire and the cool moonlight.
(200) Similarly, the man who is fallen in doubt does not know what is true and what is false, what is
wrong and what is right, and what is beneficial and what is not.
(201) Just as a congenitally blind man does not know whether it is night or day, similarly the
doubting man does not know anything.
योगसं य तकमाणं ानसंि छ नसंशयम्|
आ मव तं न कमािण िनब नि त धनंजय
Arjuna, actions do not bind him who has surrendered to God all his actions according to the
Karmayoga, and whose doubts have been torn to pieces by wisdom, and who is having self-
realization. (41)
(202) Therefore, there is no greater sin than doubt. Doubt is the snare of destruction for every being.
(203) For this reason you should drop this doubt, you should defeat first this doubt which exists
when there is absense of knowledge.
(204) When there is darkness of ignorance, this doubt develops very much, and therefore the way of
faith is totally closed.
(205) This doubt does not remain in the heart only, but grasps the intellect also, and then the whole
trinity of worlds is full of doubt for this man.
त माद ानसंभूतं थं ानािसना मनः|
िछ वैनं संशयं योगमाित ोि भारत
Therefore Arjuna, cutting to pieces with the sword of wisdom, this doubt which is born in your
heart, due to ignorance, you must establish yourself in Karmayoga in the shape of equanimity of mind,
and stand up (for fight). (42)
