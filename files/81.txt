(332) O Partha, there is one thing more, you see! If likes and dislikes are destroyed, there is no
danger for the sense-organs and active organs functioning while surrounded by sense-objects.
(333) The Sun in the sky touches the world with his rays but does he become dirty by the contact?
(334) Similarly he who is disinterested in the sense-objects and who is fully blissful in himself,
remains devoid of desire or anger.
(335) Even then, in the objects also he does not consider anything other than himself- then how and
to whom will the object be disturbing?
(336) If water can be drowned in water or fire can be burnt by fire, then perhaps the man who is
himself full, will be over-powered by the contact with objects.
(337) So, when the man himself becomes one and remains in that unity, his intellect is really steady -
have no doubt about this.
पसादे सवदुःखानां हािनर योपजायते|
पस नचेतसो ाशु बुि ः पयवित ते
When this peace of mind is attained, all his sorrows come to an end and the intellect of such a
person of happy and steady mind, withdraws inwardly and becomes well-established in Atman. (65)
(338) Please see. Where there is unbroken steadiness of intellect like this, all the sorrows of the
worldly life have no entry in it.
(339) It is like a man in whose stomach there is a fountain of nectar, does not feel the pangs of
hunger and thirst.
(340) Similarly when heart is happy, where is sorrow? There, the intellect automatically rests in the
Atman.
(341) Just as a lamp kept in a place where there is no wind, does not flicker, so is the man of steady
mind, well-versed in the yoga.
नाि त बुि रयु य न चायु य भावना|
न चाभावयतः शाि तरशा त य क
ु तः सुखम्
He who has no control over his mind and whose senses are not functioning reasonably, cannot
think of God with faith and how can he have happiness whose mind has no peace? (66)
(342) One who has no saddle of this Yoga on his mind, becomes a prey to the sense-objects.
