(220) Then it will cool the body by its touch, make the tongue dance with delight by its taste, and
provoke the ears to say “Great! Great!” by its sound.
(221) Similarly to listen to this story is the ultimate happiness to the ear, and is the destroyer of the
sorrow of worldly life without any harm.
(222) When only by uttering a verbal charm, the enemy is going to die, why should we wield
daggers? When the ailment is going to be cured by milk and sugar, why should the extract of neem
be taken?
(223) Similarly without harassment to the mind, and without giving pain to the organs, here there is
liberation offered in merely listening.
(224) Dnyandeva, the disciple of Guru Nivrutti, says, “Please listen to the meaning of the Geeta,
with all the peaceful attention you have.’’
इित शीम गव ीतासूपिनष सु ब िव ायां योगशा ते,
शीक
ृ णाजुनसंवादे ानकमसं यासयोगो नाम चतुथ ऽ यायः
Thus in the Upanishads sung by the Lord, in the science of knowledge of Brahman, in the scripture
of yoga, and in the dialogue between ShriKrishna and Arjuna, the fourth chapter by name “The yoga
of knowledge, action and renunciation” comes to an end. (4)

Chapter 5
The Yoga of Renunciation of Action
अजुन उवाच -
सं यासं कमणां क
ृ ण पुनय गं च शंसिस|
त छेय एतयोरे क
ं त मे बूिह सुनेिि तम्
Arjuna said, “O Krishna, you praise Saankhyayoga (The yoga of renunciation) and again you
propagate the yoga of action. Pray, tell me decidedly which of the two is beneficial to me.” (1)
(1) Then Partha said to Shrikrishna, “My Lord, what type of talk is this? Had you spoken one thing
definitely, my mind could have thought about it.
(2) Earlier you told me the various ways by which we should give up actions; but then you are now
sponsoring the yoga of action.
