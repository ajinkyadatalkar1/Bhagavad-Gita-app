(155) The three worlds began to tremble, the mountains Meru and Mandara began to
shake and the water of the sea was raised as high as Kailasa.
(156) The base of the earth was about to be upturned, the sky was about to be hit and
the stars were about to be showered down.
(157) The gods ran here and there, shouting ‘Gone! Gone is this world!’ and in the
world of Brahma there was great ballyhoo to this effect.
(158) Though it was day, the Sun as if disappeared and throughout the three worlds
there was great cry apprehending annihilation.
(159) At that time the primordial man, Lord Shri Krishna thought that perhaps the
universe will come to an end and being somewhat surprised, He, by His great
power made the whole panic subside.
(160) It was, therefore, that the whole world somehow became steady. Otherwise
when Lord Krishna and others blew their conches, it was as if the age had come to
an end.
(161) Though the original sound subsided, its echoes were resounding still, by which
alone, the army of Kauravas was disturbed.
(162) Just as a lion tears apart the elephants by forcefully entering their group, this
sound was tearing the hearts of Kauravas by fear.
(163) When they listened to the great deafening sound, they became extremely
nervous though standing in the field; and started shouting warnings to others to be
aware!
अथ यवि थता वा धातरा ा किप वजः|
पवृ े श तसंपाते धनु य पा डवः
Now, seeing your sons arrayed against him and when missiles were ready to be hurled, Arjuna,
son of Pandu, took up his bow. (20)
(164) However, those great warriors among them, who were brave of heart and strong in body,
somehow controlled the army.
(165) Then they simultaneously rose with redoubled enthusiasm and advanced boldly towards their
enemies and by their march the whole trinity of worlds was greatly disturbed.
