worldly life has no end.
(227) So long as the fast blowing wind has not become still, we have to say that waves are an
unending fact.
(228) For example, when the Sun sets, then only mirage disappears; and when the lamp is
extinguished, its light also disappears.
(229) So, this tree comes to an end only when knowledge, which destroys the basic Maya (or
Avidya) comes into existence.
(230) Similarly it is not wrong to say that this tree has no beginning; it is logical according to what
we have just now said.
(231) When there is no real existence to the tree of the worldly life, who can say that it has a
beginning?
(232) We can say that a certain thing has a beginning, if that thing really comes into existence
somewhere, but how can there be a beginning to a thing which is not real?
(233) Therefore, who can be named as a mother of one who is not at all born? Thus, this tree is
proved beginningless because it has no reality at all.
(234) How can we prepare a horoscope of a child of a barrern woman? Can we imagine that there is
blue land in the sky?
(235) O Pandava, who will pluck the stem of the flower of the sky? Therefore, how can there be a
beginning to this world which has no reality?
(236) If an earthen pot is not prepared, its non-existence is always there, which has no beginning.
Please know that this tree is non-existing and thus is without a beginning.
(237) O Arjuna, please see now. When there is no beginning and no end to anything, its existence in
the middle is also a false thing.
(238) It is like the mirage, which neither begins from any mountain, nor merges into a sea, and its
appearance itself is an illusion.
(239) Similarly this tree has no beginning and no end, and gives a false notion of existence by a
wonderful illusion, in the middle, the present.
(240) Just like a rainbow with many brilliant colours is seen, so, this worldly life appears to be true
to an ignorant person.
