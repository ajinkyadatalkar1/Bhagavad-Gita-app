weapon or he falls into fire.
(371) When the mind is thus absorbed into itself, it does not pay any heed to the body, it forgets
everything about the body because it is enjoying highest kind of happiness.
तं िव ाद् दुःखसंयोगिवयोगं योगसंि तम्|
स िन येन यो यो येोगो ऽ िनिव णचेतसा
That state which is called yoga which is free from the contact with sorrow, should be known as
such, and this yoga should be resolutely practised with a mind without any weariness. (23)
(372) When the mind once gets the happiness above said, though it is occupied by thoughts of
worldly life upto that time, does not now even remember the pangs of that life.
(373) That is the beauty of yoga, the royal dignity of contentment, and for it only, knowledge is meant
to be attained.
(374) That happiness becomes even visible to us in the person of the yogi by regular practice of
yoga and by having its glimpse, one becomes himself that happiness.
संक पपभवा कामां य वा सवानशेषतः|
मनसैवेि दयगामं िविनय य समंततः
Completely renouncing all desires arising from thinking about the world and objects, and fully
restraining the whole group of senses from all sides, by the mind only, (24)
(375) O Arjuna, this yoga is not so difficult. By slaying the two vices namely desire and anger who
are the children of thought-projection, we should put that “thought” to great grief due to death of
his child.
(376) When that thought hears about the death of objects of senses, and knows that the sense organs
are also completely subordinated, it kills itself like a man who beats his chest and dies lamenting
about the death of his son.
(377) If the mind is so intensely ascetic then the tricks of projections of thought will come to an end
and the intellect will live peacefully in the palace of courage.
