तेषामेवानुक पाथमहम ानजं तमः|
नाशया या मभाव थो ानदीपेन भा वता
Being established in their identification with Atman and being moved by compassion for them, I
dispel the darkness born out of ignorance, by the brilliant lamp of wisdom. (11)
(141) And therefore for those who have made their Atman as a place where I can live, and who have
considered everything else as false compared to me.
(142) I always walk as a torch-bearer in front of them who are very great men of wisdom; O, the
great warrior!
(143) I destroy and dispel the night of ignorance which is full of darkness, and for them I become the
constant sunrise of knowledge.
(144) Saint Dnyaneshwar says, ‘‘When the dearest god of devotees, the Purushottama, said like this,
Arjuna said– ‘‘I am totally contented.’’
(145) "Sir, please pay heed! You have clearly swept away the dirt of worldly life from me and I
have become free from the fire of birth and death.
(146) I feel that the purpose of my being born is fulfilled and I have understood the secret
significance of my life.
(147) Now my life has accomplished what was meant for it. Great luck has blessed me today
because straight from the mouth of God, I have heard these nectar-like words.
(148) Now the screen of delusion has been removed from me by the light of this divine teaching,
and, therefore, I am fortunate enough to see you as you really are.

Arjuna said, "O my Lord, you are the Brahman beyond everything. You are the abode supreme,
and you are also the greatest purifier. You are called as the eternal male-principle (Purusha), the
divine primordial God, unborn and greatly glorious. (12)
(149) O the Lord of the World! You are that Parabrahman which is the final place of rest for all the
great five elements and you are the most sacred principle.
