(85) Then the pleasures and pains suffered through those desires are valued and re-valued by a
certain faculty of consciousness,
(86) which analyses them as pleasure, as pain, as merit, as sin, as good and as bad separately.
(87) It is that faculty by which the soul can examine the good and bad, small and big, and can
recognize the objects.
(88) It is the root cause of the light of knowledge and the enhancement of piety and it is the liaison of
the Jeeva with Shiva (soul and the cosmic spirit).
(89) Dear Arjuna, - That should be known as the intellect. Now listen to the signs of unmanifest
Prakriti.
(90) This unmanifest principle is the same as the Prakriti described in the doctrine of Saankhyas.
(91) I have already told you about the two kinds of Prakriti according to the Saankhya and yoga
systems of philosophy.
(92) In that context, I have told you about the Jeeva which is the abstract kind of Prakriti and that is
the same Prakriti which is here categorized as unmanifest principle.
(93) As the stars fade when there is sunrise and as activities of people cease when the sun sets,
(94) Or Arjuna, when the body dies, everything related to it remains hidden in the stock of past
Karma.
(95) Or the whole tree remains in the seed, or thread is in the piece of cloth.
(96) Similarly, all the elements and living beings remain hidden there in subtle form by dropping
their qualities related to the visible bodies.
(97) Arjuna! Know that, that state is called the unmanifest. Now listen to the separate qualities of all
the organs.
(98) Know that the organs viz. ears, eyes, skin, nose and tongue which are five are the instruments of
'knowing'.
(99) When all these function collectively, the intellect examines everything to decide whether the
contact is pleasurable or painful.
(100) Then, speech, hands, feet, anus and urinary organ are the five organs,
(101) Which are called action organs. Please listen." Like this the Master of Liberation, Shrikrishna
