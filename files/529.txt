(55) Dear son of Pandu, it has no fruit which can be eaten, no flower
which can be smelt. What is, is only this tree.
(56) Though it has its root above, it is always green because it is not
like a tree uprooted and kept upside down.
(57) Though it is true that this tree is called to be having "roots above",
it is a fact that there are more roots to this tree at the lower level also,
which are innumerable.
(58) Just as the banian and peepul trees have secondary roots growing
out of their branches, similarly this tree has many roots at low level,
which grow as fast as grass.
