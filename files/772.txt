(1084) O Dhananjaya, when he attains his own unity with Brahman, his efforts towards that
realization gradually become slow.
(1085) Then, the state which is the final ceremony of desirelessness, which is the end of study and
learning or the ripeness of the fruit of yoga practice-
(1086) That state of peace, O the fortunate one, is saturated in him and thus he becomes entitled to be
himself, the absolute Brahman.
(1087) Just as the Moon on the fourteenth night of the bright fortnight, is slightly less than the fullness
of the fifteenth night, and just as gold of the quality of one less number is of lesser value that the
pure gold,
(1088) Or, just as only that much water which is just now mixed in the sea shows its movement to
some extent, but other part of sea is very smooth and still,
(1089) So is the slight difference between the absolute abstract Brahman and this man who has
become one with the Brahman; but by the quality of this peace in him, he removes that difference
also.
(1090) But, when a man does not so become totally merged into the Brahman, and only experiences
that state of Brahman, is said to be having the eligibility of that unity.
ब भूतः पस ना मा न शोचित न कां ित|
समः सवषु भूतेषु म ि ं लभते पराम्
When he becomes one with Brahman, he is very peaceful in his consciousness; he does not feel
sorry about anything, nor desires to get anything; he has equanimity towards all Beings and thus he
attains the supreme devotion for me. (54)
(1091) O the son of Pandu, when he attains this eligibility to be one with Brahman, the peace which
is the natural state in self-knowledge is well-established in him, nay, he is seated on that seat of
peace.
(1092) For example, the very heat which cooks the food, has to be cooled down in that food; and
then only the food which is somewhat cool, is fit to be enjoyed.
(1093) Or having the flood of rainy season finished, the river becomes calm in the "Sharad" season;
or when the singing is stopped, the accompaniments also stop;
(1094) Similarly, all the efforts which were being taken in the penance for self-realization become
quiet when realization takes place.
