(550) He is beyond all development. He grasps the power of grasping; and He is more than the most
of all the greatest.
(551) Just as a shell gives a false impression of silver to an ignorant, though it is not actually silver;

visible effect of universe;
(553) Or just as there is no essential difference between the water and the waves; He has become the

this world;
(556) Similarly He is not affected or spent up by anything coming to an end; and He is comparable
with Himself only.

स सविव जित मां सवभावेन भारत
O Bharat, the wise unconfused man who thus realizes me as the supreme person, knows all and
constantly worships me with all his mental faculties. (19)
(559) But dear Dhananjaya, let this be. He who has known me after the dawn of knowledge has
