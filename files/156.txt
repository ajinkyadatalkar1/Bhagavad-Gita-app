(35) Similarly, if we are endowed with the blessings of Guru, what is
unattainable for us? Therefore that limitless principle also can be
grasped by me - So I say - says Dnyandeva.
(36) By that grace, I will speak and show you the form of the formless
and make it possible for the senses to enjoy that which is beyond
them.
(37) Now please listen. The Lord in whom the fame, the prosperity, the
generosity, the wisdom, the desirelessness and the glory - all these
six great virtues are established -
(38) and is called Bhagvan on that account, and at the same time is the
companion of the man who is without attachment, said, “O Partha,
please be attentive now.”
शीभगवानुवाच-
अनािशतः कमफलं काय कम करोित यः|
स सं यासी च योगी च न िनरि नन चािकयः
The Lord said, “He who does his duty without expecting the fruit of actions is a Sanyasi
(Sankhyayogi) and a yogi (Karmayogi) both. He is no Sanyasi (renouncer) who has merely renounced
the sacred fire; even so he is no yogi, who has merely given up all activity. (1)
(39) The Lord said, “Just listen. Yogi and the renouncer are one. You may perhaps think them to be
separate. But if one considers carefully, they are one and the same.
(40) If we eliminate the appearance of second name, the yoga is itself Sanyasa. At the level of
Brahman, there is no difference between them.
(41) It is like calling a man by two different names or going to the same place by two paths.
(42) For example, if we put water in different pots, water is the same but it is in two different
places. So the difference between Yoga and Sanyasa should also be considered similar.
(43) O Arjuna, the most popular opinion in the world is that he who performs all actions, but has no
desire for the fruit should be considered as a yogi.
