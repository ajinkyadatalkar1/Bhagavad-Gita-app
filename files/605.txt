(386) But cunning men put before the cow the dead body of a calf properly stuffed by grass etc., to
create illusion that it is alive; and then induce the cow to give milk.
(387) Similarly, here people send invitations to various persons for attending their fictitious
ceremonies and simply rob them by way of presents and offer-ings.
(388) So, in this way such evil persons sometimes perform sacrifices and in these sacrifices, they
desire to kill many animals.
अहंकारं बलं दप कामं कोधं च संिशताः|
मामा मपरदेहेषु पि य तोऽ यसूयकाः
They take refuge in their egoism, their strength, their sullenness, their lust, their anger and being
jealous they hate me residing in their own bodies as well as the bodies of others. (18)
(389) Then they make a great show of their initiations, etc., by drums and bugles in public, which is
only false!
(390) In this way their pride reaches the highest peak, and just as if darkness is painted by black
paint;
(391) Their stupidity becomes more solid, their arrongance reaches its height, ego is doubled and
their thoughtless behaviour becomes more emphatic.
(392) Then in order to wipe out the name of anybody else from the face of the earth, their arrogant
strength becomes very dominant.
(393) So, when their pride and power become stronger, the sea of their ego overflows the shores of
restraint.
(394) When their pride so overflows, their desires develop devilishly giving vent to anger,
(395) Which flares off like a store house of oil and Ghee being gutted by fire, and aggravated by
winds.
(396) When the pride and ego become so smeared by desire and anger,
(397) Would such demonic people hesitate to commit any kind of violence, which they fancy?
(398) Then, O the great archer, these people sacrifice their own flesh and blood in the pits of
sacrifice in order to achieve their aims of destroying others.
(399) They burn living bodies and thus give trouble to me, who dwell as Atman in that body.
