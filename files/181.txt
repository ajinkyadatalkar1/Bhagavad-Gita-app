(352) When one gives the senses their dues with proper care, then the mind itself increases its own
contentment.
यदा िविनयतं िच मा म येवावित ते|
िनः पृहः सवकामे यो यु इ यु यते तदा
When the mind, being controlled in this way enters and stays in the Atman only and the man is
free of desire for any objects, he is properly called a yogi, (united with me). (18)
(353) Where such exactness in outward actions is achieved, and the happiness in the consciousness
goes on increasing, there the yoga is achieved without effort, and hard study.
(354) Just as by dint of good luck, but actually due to efforts done in the right direction, fortune and
riches enter one’s house of their own accord.
(355) So the man of self-control gradually and naturally begins to study yoga and gets the result of
self-realization.
(356) O Pandava, thus he who can by his good luck, achieve this yoga, becomes the glorious king on
the throne of liberation.
यथा दीपो िनवात थो ने गते सोपमा मृता|
योिगनो यतिच य यु जतो योगमा मनः
For the yogi, whose mind is under control and who is studying the yoga of being united with
Atman, a simile is generally used. It is said that he is like a lamp with steady flame, kept in a wind-
less place. (19)
(357) When self control in the actions is joined with the practice of yoga, the yoga becomes a sacred
place like Prayaga, and his mind, of its own accord, becomes still within itself.
(358) You should call this man as well-established in yoga. Here you should also note that a simile
of a lamp kept in a wind-less place is very useful.
(359) Now, surmising what is in your mind we will be telling something to you, which please attend,
giving your mind to it.
(360) Why is it that you are aiming at being successful in this yoga, but are afraid to make necessary
study?
(361) O Arjuna, do not make an issue of this. These naughty sense-organs magnify smaller problems
of the study and threaten the yoga!
