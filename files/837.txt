The robe of one became very hot.
This refers to a story about the sages Vasistha and Vishwamitra. There
was a constant desire in Vishwamitra's mind that he should be given the
status of Brahmarshi - the sage who has knowledge of Brahman, but the
real Brahmarshi was Vasistha. Vasishtha asked him to bring the Sun,
the sea and mount Meru to give witness to the effect that Vishwamitra
was a Brahmarshi. Vishamitra could not invoke them. Vasistha, then by
his great occult powers, put his robe on the ground, and that robe
became as brilliant as the Sun, Waters in his Kamandalu (a bowl used
by sages) became sea and his staff became like the mountain Meru. This
story shows the powers of sages.

"One created duplicate worlds -''
The King Trishanku had a great desire to reach the higher planes of
the heaven, by his physical body, but because of some fault of his in the
past, he was having a curse upon him that he would belong to a
"Chandala'' caste. The sage Vishwamitra tried to raise him so as to reach
heaven by his physical body, by doing a particular sacrifice, but even
then Indra, the King of the heaven world did not consent to let him enter
the heaven, while Vishwamitra had raised him upto a certain height, or
level in the space. Thus Trishanku remained as if hanging in between the
earth and the heaven. So, in order to give Trishanku, his desired place,
Vishwamitra began to create another duplicate world, in the heaven of
which Trishanka might have his heavenly place. Seeing this strange
power of Vishwamitra. Indra pacified Vishmitra and gave Trishanku a
status of a Star.
This story alludes to the occult powers of sages.
