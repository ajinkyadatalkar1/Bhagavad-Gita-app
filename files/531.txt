attention.
(69) Then the eagerness to listen became so great in the mind of Arjuna,
that it was as if trying to embrace the sky from all the directions.
(70) Or Arjuna was the new sage Agasti, who had appeared in order to
gulp down the whole teaching of Lord Shrikrishna, which was as vast
as ocean.
(71) When the Lord saw that the eagerness in the heart of Arjuna is
indescribably increased, he, with great satisfaction honoured that
intensity to listen.
शी भगवानुवाच-
ऊ वमूलमधःशाखम थं पाहर ययम्|
छ दांिस य य पणािन य तं वेद स वेदिवत्
The Lord said, "The tree which has roots at the top and branches downward, is endless and is
called Ashwattha. The Vedas are its leaves and one who knows the nature of this tree is the knower
of Vedas. (1)
(72) My dear Dhananjaya, the supreme Brahman is the root of this tree.
(73) Actually, that which is the only one single principle has no such levels or parts like the top or
the middle or the low.
(74) That principle is a sound which cannot be heard, the fragrance which cannot be experienced by
nose, and the joy which is without contact with the objects of senses;
(75) That which is itself nearer, which is itself beyond, which is both at the back and in the front,
which is invisible but is seen without the observer;
(76) That which becomes the universe when name and form are attached to it;
(77) That which is sheer knowledge without the knower and the object of knowing and which is the
complete void of the sky, but is completely full of happiness.
(78) That which is neither the cause nor the effect; that which is neither duality nor non-duality; and
that which is with itself alone as Atman.
