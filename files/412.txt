(116) O Arjuna, that is called mind, about which there is no doubt at all. Now please listen to the
various objects of the mind and the senses.
(117) Touch, sound, shape, taste and smell are the five objects of the sense organs.
(118) Through these five doors, knowledge runs out just as a calf, seeing green pasture, runs out of
