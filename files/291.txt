Ravana fight?" The answer comes, "Just as Rama and Ravana."
(39) Similarly I say that the talk of Lord ShriKrishna in the ninth
chapter is just like his talk in the ninth chapter, (and there is nothing
to be compared with it). Those who know the meaning of Geeta
properly, will agree with this judgement.
(40) In this way. I have explained the first nine chapters according to
my under-standing. Now please listen to the latter half of the book.
(41) In this second half, Shrikrishna tells Arjuna, his own important
and other manifestations, which beautiful and interesting account
will be given in details.
(42) No doubt, Marathi is the common people's language, but by the
help of its beauty, the mood of peace will surpass the principle
literary mood of romanticism and these Marathi Ovis will be
beautiful ornaments of Marathi literature.
(43) If you read the original Sanskrit and then carefully read Marathi,
and understand the meaning perfectly, you will not be able to know
which is the original text.
(44) It is like being unable to know which decorates the other, when the
body is so beautiful that ornaments look beautiful because of it.
(45) Similarly the Marathi language and the Sanskrit language are
sitting on one seat and appear equally beautiful because of their
similar meanings. Please see this clearly for yourself.
(46) Whenever any abstract mood of literature finds expression in a
beautiful form, there is continuously increasing interest and the
intelligence says that at last it has gained due dignity.
