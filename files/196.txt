Yoga of Self-knowledge and
Objective Knowledge
शीभगवानुवाच -
म यास मनाः पाथ योगं यु ज मदाशयः|
असंशयं समगं मां यथा ा यिस त छृ णु
ानं तेऽहं सिव ानिमदं व या यशेषतः|
य ा वा नेह भूयोऽ य ात यमविश यते
The Lord Shri Krishna said, “O Arjuna, now listen as to how, with your mind devoted to me with
great love and practising yoga, with dependence on me, you will know me in my totality and without
any doubt. (1)
I shall tell you all this wisdom without reserve, about my abstract nature as well as my aspect of
visible qualified form, after knowing which nothing else remains to be known in this world. (2)
(1) Saint Dnyaneshwar says, “Please listen. Then Shri Anant (Shri Krishna) said to Partha, “You
have now attained the state of yogi.
(2) I will tell you the self-knowledge as well as knowledge of the mundane world in such a way that
you will know me totally, like a gem kept on an open palm.
(3) You will perhaps ask me, "What is the business of worldly knowledge here?" But we have to
have that knowledge first.
(4) Then at the time of self-knowledge the eyes of this mundane knowledge are closed, just as a boat
tied at the shore does not sail.
(5) Similarly that where the knowledge about outward objects cannot step in, from where thought
turns back and logic loses its confidence.
(6) That, O Arjuna, is called knowledge, in other words wisdom of the self; and the worldly life
which is different from this self-knowledge is called objective knowledge (Vidnyana) and to
consider that life as true is ‘ignorance’.
