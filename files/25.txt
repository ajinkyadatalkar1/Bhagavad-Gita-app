(63) O Lord, I have spoken this with a bit of intimacy and entreated you
by bowing to your feet, because your heart is broad and generous
enough.
(64) It is natural for parents that though their child speaks
inarticulately, they are happier to listen to it.
(65) Similarly you have accepted me, saints like you have considered
me to be your own. Therefore, it is natural that you will sympathize
with me about the lacunae in my speech. Is it necessary to pray again?
(66) But my crime is quite extra-ordinary because I am trying to grasp
the meaning of Geeta. It is because of this that I am praying that you
may please listen to it very kindly.
(67) Without giving a thought to the difficulties of the task, my mind
has ventured to do so. Otherwise how can a fire-fly shine in brilliant
sunlight?
(68) I am doing this adventure ignorantly just as a little bird, a lapwing
may try to suck up the ocean with the help of its tiny beak.
(69) If one wants to cover the whole sky with bare hands, one must be
larger than the sky, which is quite impossible. When one thinks
properly, this task is also quite impossible.
(70) When the God Shankara was describing the depth of the meaning
of Geeta, the Goddess Bhavani was surprised and asked, “How great
is the doctrine of Geeta?"
(71) The God Shankara replied, “I do not know. My dear, just as your
beauty is new every moment, this doctrine of Geeta is also new every
time.
