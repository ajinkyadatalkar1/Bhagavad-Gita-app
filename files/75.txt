(276) O Arjuna, therefore, the yoga of action with intelligent application is definitely superior and
has solid foundation. You should discard from your mind the hope for fruit.
(277) Those who abide by this yoga are only able to go beyond this life, because they have dropped

with me. (53)
(283) The intellect being united with the senses (like hearing etc, of various opinions) becomes very
