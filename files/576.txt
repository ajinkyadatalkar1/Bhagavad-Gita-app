called Geeta, I have become doubly strong by my great fortune.
(32) My speech had observed the practice of speaking the truth for
many many Kalpas and O the Great Teacher! It has attained this
benevolent state, as the supreme fruit of that penance.
(33) I have had done many meritorious acts in the past and that is why I
had the right inclination to praise your virtuous greatenes and it has
paid me back so nicely.
(34) I was entangled in the forest of the false concept of Jeeva, and was
held bound in the town of Death, but today the whole bad condition
is over.
(35) I say this because I have got the fortune to praise your fame which
has been well known as Geeta, which detroys the heaviest appearance
of the unreal universe.
(36) Just see this. Can we call a man penniless pauper in whose house
the Goddess of Prosperity, Mahalaxmi, comes of her own accord, to
stay happily?
(37) And if by luck, the Sun comes to stay in the house of the darkness,
can we not say that this darkness is itself the light of the world?
(38) Does not the God in comparison of whose greatness the whole
universe is only a speck of dust, comes within the grasp of a
devotional yearning?
(39) Similarly, my writing in praise of Geeta by my commentary is as
impossible as enjoying the fragrance of the flower of the sky; but you
being the most powerful Guru, have fulfilled even that aspiration of
mine!
