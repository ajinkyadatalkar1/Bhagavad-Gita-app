divergent. For, one who is firmly established in any one of the two gets the fruit of both. (4)
(26) Otherwise, O Partha, how can those who are foolish know anything definitely about Saankhya
and yoga?
(27) They are anyway ignorant only. Therefore they say that these two are different. For example,
are there different lights in two similar lamps?
(28) Those who have correctly realised the nature of Atman by their own experience do not make
any difference between the two and take them to be one only.
यत् सां यैः पा यते थानं त ोगैरिप ग यते|

The supreme state which is reached by the followers of the path of renunciation is attained also
by the followers of the yoga of action. Therefore he alone is the seer who sees the Saankhyayoga and
Karmayoga as one in their finality. (5)
(29) And what is attained by Saankhyas is also reached by yogis and therefore such is their unity.
(30) For example, there is no difference between the space and the sky. Thus he who recognizes the
unity of yoga and sanyasa, (path of action and path of renunciation),
(31) Really, sees the dawn of wisdom and he who understands both the paths of Saankhya and yoga
to be undivided, really sees his own self.
सं यास तु महाबाहो दुःखमा ुमयोगतः|

Without Karmayoga, however the path of renunciation is difficult to accomplish, whereas the
Karmayogi who keeps his mind fixed on God reaches Brahman in no time, O Arjuna. (6)
(32) Dear Partha, he who travels inwardly, on the path of yoga, performing his actions without
attachment, reaches the peak of bliss very early.
(33) But he who cannot be successful in that yoga of action, in vain gets caught in craving for
attainment of the state of renunciation but can never get it.
योगयु ो िवशु ामा िविजता मा िजतेि दयः|

The Karmayogi who has fully conqured his mind and his senses and is inwardly pure of heart and
