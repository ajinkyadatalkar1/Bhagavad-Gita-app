them, with appropriate offerings.
(72) They get there whatever they expect, but you should know it definitely that it is the fruit of their
own actions.
(73) In this world of human beings, there is truly nothing else which takes or gives in return, except
action, which indicates its own fruit.
(74) For example, as you sow, so shall you reap or reflection in the mirror depends on the object in
front of the mirror.
(75) Or, O the crowned one! It is our own voice which we hear as echo in a deep valley, from the
top of a precipice, through the medium of air.
(76) O Arjuna, similarly I am only a witness to all this type of worship. Here each one gets fruit
according to his faith.
चातुव य मया सृ ं गुणकमिवभागशः|
त य कतारमिप मां िव यकतारम ययम्
The four divisions of Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shoodra, were created by me classifying
them according to the Gunas (Qualities) of Prakriti dominant in each and ordaining pertinent duties to
them; but you should know that though I created this order, I am a non-doer and undestructible. (13)
(77) Now know that I have created the four classes according to the qualities and particular duties.
(78) I have taken the support or means of the nature, using the variations of the qualities and thus
classified their particular duties in the framework of society.
(79) O! The wielder of the bow; here only one homogeneous class of people was existing originally
but I have divided it into four, by consideration of qualities and natural tendency of action.
(80) Therefore, O Partha, know that for this reason I am not the doer of this classification of the
divisions at all.
न मां कमािण िल पि त न मे कमफले पृहा|
इित मां योऽिभजानाित कमिभन स ब यते
Actions do not stick to me and I have no craving for the fruit of actions; he who knows me like
this in reality, is also not bound by his actions. (14)
(81) He who knows that this classification has come into being because of me, but I have not myself
done it, becomes liberated.
