महषयः स पूव च वारो मनव तथा|
म ावा मानसा जाता येषां लोक इमाः पजाः
The seven great sages and the earlier four Manus whose progeny is all these beings are born out
of my mind (6)
(92) The seven sages viz Kashyapa etc. who are the best in respect of virtues and knowledge;
(93) And those four Manus like Swayambhuva the seniormost, main among the fourteen Manus,
(94) Are eleven in all, who were born from my mind, O, the wielder of a good bow, who started the
functions of this world;
(95) Before the systems of these worlds were not started, before the construction
of the three worlds was not begun, the group of the (five) elements was undisturbed.
(96) These sages and Manus were born at that time, and then they created the various beings and they
also appointed the presiding regents to control them.
(97) Thus, these eleven were the kings and all the beings are their progenies; you should know that
all this expanse is mine.
(98) Just see for example - First a seed is sown; then there is a sprout and it becomes the root, and
from the sprout, the trunk and large branches grow.
(99) From these large branches, smaller branches and from them leaves and tender leaves grow.
(100) Next come the flowers and fruit. So, the whole tree, if properly seen, is in essence the seed
only.
(101) Thus I am the only one at first and then I produced the mind, and from that mind were born the
seven sages and the 'Manu's.
(102) They created and appointed Lokpalas, the regents who, afterwards created the Lokas (worlds)
and from them all the beings were born.
(103) In this way all the universe is spread by me only but this is known by those who understand it
through inner faith and intuition.
