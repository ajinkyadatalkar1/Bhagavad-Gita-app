(1376) Though a little ray of light of the Sun makes the lotus bud bloom, the whole Sun in his full
glory arises for it.
(1377) The cloud gives rain enough to quench the thirst of the earth and to fill the sea, but is not the

(1378) Therefore, O the treasure of compassion! The most generous Lord, is not the answering to my
query just an instrument for generating this great generosity in you?
(1379) Thereupon the Lord said- "Let us drop this subject because this is not the occasion for going
into argument about these things. Please be sure that by doing as I have just now told, you will
definitely come unto me.
(1380) When salt falls into sea, does it not dissolve in the same moment? Has it any reason to wait

(1382) Thus I have shown you how, beginning from doing one's duty, step by step, the means reach

(1385) Then, O Partha, the division between the means and the goal does not remain, or you have
nothing more to do.
(1386) My dear, because you have offered all your actions always to me, you have my grace andâ€“
(1387) By the strength of this grace, the impediment in the way of fighting will be removed. I have

(1388) Geeta is the light by which ignorance is dissipited together with the false appearance and
everywhere there is perception of me only, and it is the manifestation of this knowledge made
clear through similes, etc.
(1389) I have taught you in various ways, the knowledge of self-realization. Now throw away your
ignorance which has created the confusion about what is the right action and what is the wrong
action.
