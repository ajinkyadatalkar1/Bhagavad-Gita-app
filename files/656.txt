(69) Similarly the faith of the man, who is completely Tamasic, and takes birth and dies again and
again in the same quality, is also Tamasic.
(70) Then just as the eye-black (collyrium) and soot (lamp-black) are not different, that faith is itself
Tamas, and not different.
(71) Similarly in the case of a soul, who is Rajasic, his faith is also Rajasic and in the man of
Sattwa, it is Sattwic.
(72) Thus the whole panorama of the universe is cast out of the three types of faith only.
(73) But you should understand the three kinds of stamps which the faith bears according to the three
qualities.
(74) For example, a tree is identified by its flowers, a man's mind is understood by the way he talks,
and the past Karma of a man is known by his present conditions.
(75) Similarly I shall tell you the signs by which the three kinds of faith can be recognised. Please
listen.
यज ते साि वका देवान् य र ांिस राजसाः|
पेता भूतगणां ा ये यज ते तामसा जनाः
The people of Sattwic quality worship gods, those of Rajasic quality worship the Yakshas and
Rakshasas (para-human Angles) and those of Tamasic quality worship the dead and the ghosts. (4)
(76) Those whose character is made up of Sattwic quality are generally fond of heavenly life.
(77) They study various sciences, select good systems of ritualistic sacrifices, and they enter the
divine world.
(78) And O great warrior! Those who are made up of Rajasic faith, worship the Rakshasas and
angels who travel through the astral world.
(79) I shall also tell you about Tamasic faith, which is like a heap of sin and very cruel and devoid
of pity.
(80) They kill animals by cruel cunning, and worship the groups of ghosts in cemeteries in ghastly
conditions in the greyish evenings.
(81) Those men are moulded using the essence of Tamas; you may know them as the very home of
Tamasic faith.
