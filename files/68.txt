भयादणादुपरतं मं य ते वां महारथाः|
येषां च वं बहमतो भू वा या यिस लाघवम्
And the great chariot-riders, who had earlier thought highly of you, will now despise you,
thinking that you have ceased to fight through fear only. (35)
अवा यवादां बहन् विद यंित तवािहताः|
िन द त तव साम य ततो दुःखतरं नु िकम्
And your ill-wishers will disparage your strength and will speak many unutterable abuses. What
can be more painful than that? (36)
(208) These will shout - “Gone! Gone! Arjuna is afraid!” Tell me if this blame is welcome in the
end!
(209) O, the Great Archer! People make great efforts and undergo many troubles or even get
themselves killed, but see that their fame is spread.
(210) But that fame is gained by you of its own accord, as unique as the sky which has no second.
(211) You have fame par excellence, and unparalleled and your qualities are the best in all the three
worlds.
(212) The kings from all the quarters of this earth have become the reciters of your praise and they
sing so loudly that even the god of death and others are surprised and afraid.
(213) Your greatness is as pure as Ganges and your fame is so all pervading that by your example
and ideal, the great warriors have learnt the lesson of best duties of Kshatriyas.
(214) By listening to the fame of your prowess, these warriors have already lost all hope of living.
(215) Just as by the roar of a lion, elephant apprehends that it is the time of his death, so, is the terror
about you in the minds of these Kauravas.
(216) Just as the mountains are afraid of the lightning, or serpents are afraid of the eagle, so these are
afraid of you at all times, O Arjuna!
(217) All that dignity will be lost and you will be subject of ridicule, if you turn back without
fighting.
(218) And if you run, these will not allow you to run; they will catch you and belittle you, and talk so
foul about you that you will not know the extent of that abuse.
