(86) But enough with this justification! Arjuna is asking- "O, the Lord
of the world! Please listen to my request."
अजुन उवाच-
सं यास य महाबाहो त विम छािम वेिदतुम्|
याग य च षीक
े श पृथ क
े िशिनषूदन
Arjuna said: O mighty- armed ShriKrishna! O the inner controller of all, O the slayer of Keshi, I
wish to know separately the truth of 'Sannyasa' and 'Tyaga' (1)
(87) Arjuna said, "My Lord, both Sanyasa and Tyaga are having the same meaning, just as Sanghata
and Sangha have the same meaning as a "group."
(88) Similarly as far as I think, both the words Sanyasa and Tyaga mean 'Tyaga' only;
(89) But if there is any difference, the Lord may kindly explain it.’’ The Lord said - "They are
different."
(90) Even then, O Arjuna, I quite understand that they appeared to you to be the same.
(91) No doubt, both the words mean the same thing as "giving up", but there is only slight difference,
which is-
(92) Sanyasa means totally to give up all action and Tyaga means only to give up the desire for the
result of action.
(93) Now I will tell you which action should be totally given up and of which action only the fruit
should be given up. Please give attention to it.
(94) On a mountain, all types of trees grow at random, but the plants in a garden or paddy do not
grow without sowing.
(95) Grasses of many varieties grow without sowing, but unless proper cultivation is made, we do
not get the rice crop.
(96) Our body is natural, but an ornament is to be prepared. River is a natural source of water, but
wells are required to be dug.
(97) Similarly, the regular and occasional actions are taking place in their natural course, but if we
do not have desire for their fruit, then these actions are not binding.
