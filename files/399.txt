He is having impartial attitude towards friend and opponent, and is unaffected by respect or
insult, similarly he is of an undisturbed mind either by cool or hot touch, and pleasure or pain, and is
free from attachment. (18)
(197) O Partha, he who has no sense of disparity and behaves with equanimity towards friend and
foe.
(198) O Pandava, he is as unconcerned as a lamp who does not choose to give light to the inmates of
