सवभूति थतं यो मां भज येक वमाि थतः|
सवथा वतमानोऽिप स योगी मिय वतते
The yogi who, being in his mind fixed in the unity of everything, worships me as existing in all
beings, is, in me only, though he exists in the world. (31)
(398) O the crowned one! He, who sees me with a sense of unity just like a thread in a piece of
cloth.
(399) Or he whose consciousness has become one, just as in every ornament which appears
different, the gold is the common metal.
(400) And whose night of ignorance is ended by the dawn of the day of unity and who knows
everything to be one, just as though the leaves of a tree are many, it is not that so many seeds are
sown in the earth, but there is only one seed and one tree.
(401) Though he is living in the body composed of five elements, how will he be confined in it? By
the greatness of his Realization, he is proved to be equal to me.
(402) By his self-experience, he comes upon my totality, and though he may not say so, he is
naturally all-pervading.
(403) Had it been possible to state clearly in words that he is having a body, but is not proud of it, I
would have told you so, in clear words.
आ मौप येन सवत समं प यित योऽजुन|
सुखं वा यिद वा दुःखं स योगी परमो मतः
O Arjuna, that yogi who looks at the happiness or sorrow with equanimity everywhere,
comparing it to his own state of mind is considered to be a great yogi. (32)
(404) Therefore, let us not go into further details. He looks at the animate and inanimate universe as
if it is he himself.
(405) His mind does not feel differently the pain or pleasure and good deed or bad deed.
(406) He considers just like the limbs of his own body, all the objects in the world, either justified
or irregular or strange, whatever they may be.
(407) Or we can say that his intellect has seen this trinity of the worlds as himself.
(408) Such a yogi has his body and people may call him happy or unhappy; but we feel that he is
really Brahman.
