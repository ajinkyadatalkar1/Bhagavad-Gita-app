even possess the whole world!
(351) He says – "I will be the owner of all the money in this world and then I will not let alone
anything that I will see!
असौ मया हतः शतुहिन ये चापरानिप|
ई रोऽहमहं भोगी िस ोऽहं बलवान् सुखी
He says- "I have killed this enemy. I will also kill others. I am God. I am the enjoyer! I am a
Siddha, a Master. I am strong. I am happy! (14)
(352) "I have killed these few enemies. I am going to kill still greater enemies and then I will rule
alone in this world.
(353) Then all will work for me. I will kill the others who will not obey me. Actually I am the God
of the whole world.
(354) "I am the king of the land which is to be enjoyed by me only, I am the home of all kinds of
pleasures! Even the God Indra will be nobody before me!"
(355) "How is it possible that anything which I do by my mind, my speech and my body, will not be
successful? Who else is there except me who has the power to give orders?"
(356) "The Time as death is powerful so long as He has not met me! If there is a totally highest peak
of happiness, I am that peak!"
आ योऽिभजनवानि म कोऽ योऽि त स शो मया|
य ये दा यािम मोिद य इ य ानिवमोिहताः
He says- "I am the righteous one! I am of the noble family. Who is there like me? I shall perform
sacrifices. If charity is to be done, it is I who am the generous man! It is I who will really derive
pleasures." These people are deluded like this by their ignorance. (15)
(357) Such a man says -"No doubt, Kubera is very rich, but he cannot be equal to me. Even the
husband of goddess Laxmi has no riches as I have."
(358) Even Brahma the God is inadequate when my large family and my relatives are considered."
(359) "These so-called Gods who call themselves as God, are really not real Gods. Nobody can be
equal to me."
(360) "I will revive the black magic which has been recently neglected by people and I shall re-
establish those rituals which are useful in destroying others."
