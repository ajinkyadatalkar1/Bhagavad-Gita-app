One who is the real renouncer, endowed with inborn Sattwa quality, is intelligent and whose
doubts are removed, does not hate any work which involves hard work nor perform any, because it is

(219) My dear, can an earthen pot get bored about earth? How far can a cloth dislike the thread?
(220) Similarly will a thing in which fire is inherent, become troubled by heat? Does a lamp ever
