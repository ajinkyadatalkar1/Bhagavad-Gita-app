(7) Now you will see that ignorance is discarded, objective knowledge dissolved and you will
remain yourself as knowledge incarnate.
(8) When this happens, the speaker becomes silent, the speech having been
stopped and the eagerness of the listener to hear is also ended. Moreover the differentiation of big
and small also does not remain any more.
(9) Such secret knowledge I am going to tell you by being aware of which, even to some extent, there
is great satisfaction of the mind.
मनु याणां सहसेषु कि तित िस ये|
यततामिप िस ानां कि मां वेि त वतः
Hardly one among thousands of men strives to realise Brahman, or fulfillment of life and of those
striving yogis some rare devotee knows me in reality. (3)
(10) Among thousands of men, there is seldom anyone who is eager about these things and among
those who are so eager the really knowledgeable person is very rare.
(11) O Arjuna, for forming an army of lakhs of soldiers, selection is made by testing the courage and
valour of each and every recruit.
(12) And among so many soldiers, when swords start snapping the limbs of opponents in a battle,
with great speed, only one is declared to be the victorious warrior.
(13) Similarly crores of aspirants jump into the ambition of reaching the knowledge of Brahman but
seldom one of them reaches the other shore.
(14) This is not an ordinary thing to explain, and it is very deep and difficult to tell and to understand
but I am going to tell you as much as I can. So please listen.
भूिमरापोऽनलो वायुः खं मनो बुि रे व च|
अह कार इतीयं मे िभ ना पक

My nature which has eight divisions is made-up of the five elements of earth, water, fire, air, sky
and also the mind, the intellect, (reasoning-power) and ego. (4)
(15) So please listen, O Dhananjaya, “This my Maya which contains the Mahat and other elements is
as if the shadow of myself.
(16) This is called Prakriti. This is divided into eight parts, and from this the three worlds come into
being.
