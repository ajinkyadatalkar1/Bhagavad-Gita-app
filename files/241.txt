(2) You are the assembly of omniscient people. I am not saying this
with pride to you. It is only an humble request that you may please
listen with attention.
(3) This is because if there are such rich maternal homes like you,
where I can take resort, then all my requests will be met and all my
aspirations will be achieved.
(4) The plantations of pleasantness have blossomed under your kind
glance, which is like a shower and I being much tired, have seen the
cool shadow and I am just rolling over in it.
(5) Sirs, you are the pools of nectar of happiness in which we can get
much kindness. Now if I am afraid of being intimate, how can I get
peace?
(6) When the child babbles innocently and walks unsteady steps, its
mother takes extreme joy in it.
(7) Similarly I have talked with this intimacy and love with an
eagerness to receive the love of saints in some way or other.
(8) Otherwise if compared to my worth as a speaker, listeners like you
are simply all knowing and the action of my speaking before you and
your listening to it is just like the son of Goddess Saraswati writing
on a slate, the lesson to be learnt by him. Is it necessary to do so?
(9) Just see, how can a fire-fly, however bright it may be, try to
challenge the brilliance of the sun? How can one easily procure food
rich enough to be served in the plate made of nectar?
(10) Sirs, is it possible to fan the cool Moon, to make the very principle
of sound listen to a song and to decorate the ornament itself?
