of attachment, perform all your duties, by being equally disinterested in success or failure.
Equilibrium of mind is called yoga. (48)
(267) You should be expert in yoga, drop the attachment to fruit, and O Arjuna, then perform all
actions with proper attention.
(268) But there should not be a feeling of elation when the work accepted by you luckily becomes
accomplished.
(269) And if by any reason, it is not successful and is thwarted, you should also not be disturbed by
the discontent in it.
(270) Consider that it is all right if the action is successful and some cause is achieved by it, but if it
is thwarted, think that, that is also alright.
(271) Please see. Whatever action is produced should be surrendered to the primordial supreme
being, then it will naturally become fulfilled and complete.
(272) Just see. This quality of the peaceful attitude of mind while performing any satisfactory or
normally unsatisfactory action is considered the state of yoga, as the laudable one.
(273) O Arjuna, the state of balance of the mind is the essence of yoga, wherein there is unity of
mind and intellect.
दूरे ण वरं कम बुि योगा नंजय|
बु ौ शरणमि व छ क
ृ पणाः फलहेतवः
बुि यु ो जहातीह उभे सुक
ृ त क
ृ ते|
त मा ोगाय यु य व योगः कमसु कौशलम्
Action with a motive is far inferior to this yoga of intelligent attitude while doing action. Please
seek refuge in this balanced intellect. Dhananjaya, those who hold hope for the fruit are narrow-
minded. (49)
Endowed with equanimity, a man drops the division of good and evil; merit and sin. Therefore,
try to imbibe this yoga. In this yoga, there is really happiness and skill. (50)
(274) O Partha, when we consider at length the nature of this yoga of dovetailing intellect with
action, we find that action performed with an aim of having fruit is far inferior in its scope.
(275) But when the same action is performed with this peaceful steadiness of mind, that action itself
when so performed totally, proves that the yoga is achieved.
