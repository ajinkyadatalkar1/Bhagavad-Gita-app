The moon of which world, is having tuberculosis.
There is a myth about the reduction of the phases of the moon, in
ancient Puranas. Moon is the son of the sage Atri. He married
twentyeight daughters of Daksha, out of whom Rohini was the most
beloved to him. Other wives were jealous, more so when the moon begot
a son by name Budh, (mercury) of his wife Rohini. Other wives went to
their father and complained about the partial behaviour of Moon.
Daksha got angry and gave a curse to the moon that he would suffer
from tuberculosis and thus the full moon started to be reduced in size
every night. This story is given to emphasize the ephemeral nature of the
life on the earth.

Dhruva the son of Uttaanapada was not really interested in permanent
unmoving seat -
Dhruva was annoyed by the insult which his step mother meted out to
him when he went near his father Uttanapada to sit on his lap. So he
went to his own mother. The mother said to him that if he wanted a
place to sit with honour, he should undergo penance to please Shri
Vishnu. The boy went to a forest and sat quietly repeating the name of
Narayana. After some years the Lord Narayana appeared before him and
listening to the story of his insult by his step mother told him that he
will be given a permanent place higher than all the sages, stars etc.; but
Dhruva did not actually desire that. Basically his penance was done to
get his insult alleviated. He wanted his right as a son of King
Uttanapada, to sit in his lap and be loved by his father.
