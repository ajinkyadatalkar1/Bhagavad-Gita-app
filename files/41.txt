Among them are teachers, fore-fathers, sons and grand-fathers, uncles, fathers-in-law, grand-sons,
brothers -in-law and relatives. (34)
(210) I have nothing to do with the hope of gaining victory. Here, after seeing all this, I feel, what is
the use of possessing a kingdom?"
(211) Arjuna further said, “If I have to kill all these persons and then enjoy all these pleasures, let
those pleasures be burnt.”
(212) He further said, “Whatever may happen in the event of our not getting those pleasures; it can
very well be tolerated or even if I have to give up my life in that event, I will accept that fate.
(213) But I cannot accept even in my dream enjoying the kingdom by killing these persons.
(214) If at all we are expected to have evil thoughts about our teachers, why are we at all born and
for whom are we to live?
(215) Every family desires to have a male child. Then is it the right fruit of that, that we should
totally wipe out our own family men?
(216) How can we even think to be hard and cruel like Vajra (thunder bolt) with these? On the
contrary, we should try to do as much good to them as possible.
(217) It is right that these persons should enjoy the things whichever we will accomplish. We should
even sacrifice our life for their welfare.
(218) Actually, it is proper for us to conquer the kings from all the ten directions and give
satisfaction to our kinsmen.
(219) Now how strange is the turn of desting, that these very kinsmen are assembled here with an
intention to fight!
(220) By leaving behind their wives, children, money, property and everything and also putting their
very life on the sharp edge of their weapons.
(221) How then can I kill each of these? Against whom should I brandish my weapons? How can I
pierce my own heart?
(222) Perhaps, you might not have considered, who these people are! But these are Bheeshma and
Drona standing here who have tremendously obliged us.
