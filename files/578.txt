fifteenth chapter, and has explained the importance of knowledge in
various ways.
(50, 51) Thus Lord Shrikrishna who is the last word in regard to pure
knowledge, has said that there is no other path effective enough as
the path of knowledge which makes a man capable of destroying all
the attachment with the mundane life and he as observer being
himself merged into the Brahman- the 'observed', and the Jeeva
becoming the emperor of the empire of the bliss of Brahman.
(52) Those who had that devout faith in the knowledge and keen
interest to acquire that knowledge, were completely satisfied in their
hearts and as if offered as an oblation their very self-hood as Jeeva,
for that knowledge.
(53) Now, love is that state of mind which goes on increasingly
involved in the subject in which it has deep interest.
(54) Therefore, it is quite natural for those people among the
inquisitive, who have not got this experience of the love, to feel eager
to attain knowledge and be anxious to maintain that state of
knowledge ever afterwards.
(55) So, their anxiety is about how that pure knowledge can be attained
and how it will go on increasing when once it is gained.
(56) Or, they have also to think as to why they are not obtaining that
knowledge, and what force is there against it, which may mislead the
seeker to wrong paths.
(57) Then they think of avoiding anything that is against knowledge
and doing everything with one-pointed attention that which will be
helpful in increasing the knowledge.
