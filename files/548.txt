(282) O Partha, that reality of oneself should be seen by oneself only, as snow causes snow to be
formed.
(283) O Dhananjaya, there is another sign of recognizing this state. Once you reach this state there is
no coming back.
(284) But only those who are replete with knowledge just as the waters at the time of final deluge
are everywhere, can achieve this state.
िनमानमोहा िजतसंगदोषा अ या मिन या िविनवृ कामाः|
ं ैिवमु ाः सुखदुःखसं ैग छ यमूढाः पदम ययं तत्
Those wise men who are free from pride and delusion, who have conquered the evil of
attachment, who are eternally one with god, whose cravings have altogether ceased and who are
completely free from all pairs of opposites known as pleasure and pain, reach that supreme immortal
state. (5)
(285) Those men whose mind is emptied of the sense of pride and attraction, like the sky at the time
when rainy season is over, which is left by all clouds;
(286) Those who are left by all types of vices just as relatives of a poor and ruthless person get
bored of him;
(287) Those whose activities are dropped gradually, because of the very firm self- realization which
is attained by them,
(288) Those who have been deserted by all doubts just as a burning tree is left by birds,
(289) Those who have no relationship with that discriminative, separatist intellect which is a land
producing all types of grass of vices and defects.
(290) Those in whose case, the pride of physical body and other sorts pride have been destroyed,
together with ignorance, just as night is itself gone at sunrise;
(291) Those whose sense of duality born of ignorance has left them just as the body gives up the life-
force when time of death is there.
(292) Those in whose mind there is drought of sense of duality just as the magic stone Parees has no
sense of duality about iron and the Sun has no recognition of darkness.
(293) Those in front of whom the feelings of pain and pleasure, as different things do not stand even
for a moment.
