(107) Or the ending of the incense after being burnt or the reduction in the weight of gold when the
dirt is burnt from it; or the waning of the Moon in the process of giving nectar, during the fortnight
earmarked for ancestral rituals.
(108) So, penance is the privations to which a man subjects his vitality, his organs and even the
whole body, in order to achieve self-realization.
(109) Many other forms of penance are described in this respect but it is mainly like the bifureation
of milk and water done by a swan.
(110) Similarly, in penance the quality of discrimination which separates the Jeeva from the body to
which it is normally attached, is required to be constantly kept alert and alive.
(111) The intellect often becomes confused in an effort to meditate on the reality of Atman; at that
time, just as the sleep and the dream come to an end when one wakes up;
(112) The man who uses intense discrimination in his effort for perception of Atman, can only be
successful in this penance.
(113) Now, humble simplicity or straightness of behaviour is described as the quality of milk in the
breast of a mother only for the careful nurture of a child or the life principle which is the same in
all the creatures of various forms, and consists of kind and courteous behaviour with all.
अिहंसा स यमकोध यागः शांितरपैशुनम्|
दया भूतेि वलोलु वं मादवं र्हीरचापलम्
Total non-violence, truthfulness, lack of anger, abandonment, peace, abstaining from malicious
gossip, pity, absence of attachment, mildness, a sense of shame about bad things and abstaining from
frivolous activities. (2)
(114) And know that non-violence implies every effort taken in order that the world should be
happy.
