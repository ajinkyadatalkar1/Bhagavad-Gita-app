Lion among the animals.
(249) Please understand that I am the Eagle in the category of birds and, therefore, he can bear me on
his back.
पवनः पवतामि म रामः श तभृतामहम्|
झषाणां मकर ाि म सोतसामि म जा वी
I am the wind amongst the blowing things and Ram amongst the wielders of weapons. I am
crocodile among the water animals and the Janhavi (Ganga) among the streams (rivers) (31)
(250) O the wielder of the bow! Without wasting even half an hour there is one flight around the
earth, going beyond the seven seas in one jump.
(251) Among such fliers, who are most speedy, I am the wind, and O son of Pandu, I am Shriram in
the wielders of weapons.
(252) Who, taking upon him the role of the protector of religion, with he help of one bow, compelled
the goddess victory to wed him alone, during the Age called ‘Tretaa’.
(253) Then standing upon the mountain Suvela in Lanka, he offered as propitiation to the ghosts in
the space, the ten heads of the king of Lanka.
(254) He restored to the gods their dignity and power, rejuvenated the religion, and was another Sun
which arose in the family of the Sun (called Surya-Wansha.)
(255) I am that Ramchandra, the beloved of Seeta, among the wielders of weapons. I am the
crocodile of large tail among the aquatic animals.
(256) I am the river Ganges among all the streams, which Ganges was held by Janhu between his
thighs and then let it go out from the thighs by breaking them.
(257) O Son of Pandu, I am the only great river Ganges which is unique, among all the streams of
water in the world.
(258) If I set about to tell you each and every one of the various manifestations in the whole nature,
even half of them would not be enumerated even after thousands of lifetimes.
