(11) But how much can I with great effort use various words to praise
you, when your particular characteristics cannot be understood by
mind or spoken by tongue?
(12) When I realize that you are not really of that nature to describe
which I try to use particular adjectives, I become shy to describe you
in anyway.
(13) But the fame of the sea that it always remains within its
boundaries is true so long as the Moon does not arise.
(14) The Somakant-stone does not offer water of its own to the Moon,
but it is the Moon, who liquefies the stone, and makes it do the same.
(15) When the spring season appears, all the trees suddenly have new
leaves, which even the trees themselves do not understand.
(16) When the lotus-flower is touched by the rays of the Sun, its state
of closed-petals does not remain so, even for a moment. Similarly salt
forgets its body as soon as it comes into contact with water.
(17) Similarly, O the respected Guru, when I remember you, I forget
myself, and just as a man, who has been fully dined and satisfied is
having fits of belching,
(18) Similarly you have rendered my state like that only. My ego has
been banished by you, and you have made my speech crazy of
praising you.
(19) Now if at all I want to praise you by keeping my identity separate,
duality between the person who has virtues, and the virtues
themselves is to be maintained.
(20) But you are the image of one total unbroken bliss of Brahman.
