(261) Or as there is no sun without light, fire without smoke, and mirror without some dirt.
(262) Similarly we have not seen knowledge alone, without these two; and just as the seed is
covered by its husk (before sprouting)
आवृतं ानमेतेन ािननो िन यवै रणा|
काम पेण कौ तेय दु पूरे णानलेन च
O The son of Kunti, knowledge is covered by this constant enemy of the wise, by name desire and
the anger which is insatiable as fire. (39)
(263) The knowledge which is pure in itself, is over-ridden by these two and therefore becomes
obscure.
(264) If we decide to first conquer these and then attain knowledge, it is not possible to defeat the
desire and anger (attraction and repulsion).
(265) In order to defeat these if we try to have strength in ourselves, that itself becomes helpful to
these, just as fuel to fire.
इि दयािण मनो बुि र यािध ानमु यते|
एतैिवमोहय येष ानमावृ य देिहनम्
The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its seat; screening the light of knowledge
through these, it (the desire) deludes the soul who is bearing the body. (40)
(266) So, whatever measures one takes to defeat them, these very measures become the factors of
strength to these and by these, even the Hatha-yogis are conquered in this world.
(267) But even though I describe these in some crooked words, there is some way to conquer these. I
will tell you; just see whether you can utilize it.
त मा विमि दया यादौ िनय य भरतषभ|
पा मानं पजिह ेनं ानिव ाननाशनम्
Therefore, O! The leader of the men in Bharata, you should first control the senses and then kill
this embodied sin, which is the destroyer of knowledge and wisdom of the self. (41)
(268) The primary base of these two is the whole group of senses, and from these senses the action
is born out of attentive attitude, and therefore you should first completely destroy them only.
