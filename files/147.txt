श नोतीहैव यः सोढुं पा शरीरिवमो णात्|
कामकोधो वं वेगं स यु ः स सुखी नरः
He alone who is able to sustain in this very life before casting off this body, the urges of desire
and anger, is the yogi and he alone is a happy man. (23)
(129) Those men of wisdom who have brought under control the various tendencies of their body are
not even aware of the pains resulting from indulgence in sense-objects.
(130) In the hearts of those, there is unbroken happiness reigning, who do not know even what is the
meaning and nature of the outer objects.
(131) But even their way of enjoying this inner happiness is quite different. They do not enjoy the
bliss like birds eating fruit but they forget their role of the enjoyer.
(132) While they are enjoying the Inner bliss or Atman, they enter such a state that it removes the
veil of ego and embraces the total unity very firmly.
(133) In that tight embrace of oneness, the soul becomes one with the Paramatman in such a deep
sense as water mixing with water.
(134) When the soul is united with the totality of Paramatman, there remains only bliss in the shape
of Atman. It is like the unity of the sky in its aloneness when the wind merges in the sky and one
cannot point out as “this is wind” and “this is the sky.”
(135) If we say that the language of duality comes to an end and only unity remains, how can there be
an observer who looks and knows that state?
(136) Therefore, I will stop this talk. How can one talk about that thing which cannot be spoken in
words? Only he who has realized himself will understand everything by this somewhat unclear
indication.
योऽ तःसुखोऽ तराराम तथाऽ त य ितरे व यः|

He, who is having inner happiness and inner rest with the inner light becomes a yogi identified
with Brahman and attains the peace that is Brahman. (24)
The seers with their sins wiped out, doubts dispelled by knowledge with mind firmly established
