(49) By experience of this knowledge, the great thinkers, who are brave, do not allow the thought of
worldly life even peep in their mind.
(50) They have withdrawn the mind by the mind and have themselves become the peace incarnate
and they do not become enslaved by their body though they are in it.
(51) They, once for all, escape the snare of the body on one flight and become one with me, as if in a
balance, equal to me -
इदं ानमुपािश य मम साध यमागताः|
सगऽिप नोपजाय ते पलये न यथि त च
Having taken refuge in this knowledge, those who have attained unity with me are not born again
with the creation of the universe nor suffer at the time of final dissolution. (2)
(52) O Arjuna, being one with me, they become equally eternal, by my eternal nature and become
complete by my completeness.
(53) As I am unlimited joy and really Siddha, being always complete, they also become like me.
There does not remain any difference.
(54) Just as the space in the pot is united with the outer space, they become equal to me, as vast and
as great as I am.
(55) Or like the various flames when extinguished, remain invisible in the lamp itself.
(56) Arjuna, like this when the movement in the duality comes to an end, then every thing with its
name and relative significance remains in the alone-ness, without the sense of I and you.
(57) So, because of this aloneness, the devotee has not to be born or involved in the creation when it
takes place.
(58) And how can those who have nothing to do with adoption of a body at the beginning of the
creation, die or come to an end at the time of final dissolution?
(59) O Dhananjaya, they are therefore beyond birth or death, because they have become one with me
through the said path of knowledge.
(60) Thus the Lord praised the path of knowledge so as to awaken in Arjuna, the interest in
knowledge.
(61) Then the condition of Arjuna was changed. His whole body became all ears and he became
totally attentive.
