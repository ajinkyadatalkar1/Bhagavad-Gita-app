(104) I will tell you the names of only top-ranking main warriors of your calibre, just as an
indication.
(105) Here is Bheeshma, son of Ganga, who is by his bravery as brilliant as Sun and the warrior
Karna who is like a lion against the elephant-like enemy.
(106) By merely the will of each of these, this world can come into existence and be destroyed. Will
not this Kripacharya alone be sufficient to finish everything easily?
(107) Here is the brave Vikarna and beyond, there is Ashwatthama to whom the God of death also
fears in his heart.
(108) There are many more like Soumadatti, who is victorious over large group of soldiers; and
those whose strength cannot be measured even by God the Creator.
अ ये च बहवः शूरा मदथ य जीिवताः|
नानाश तपहरणाः सव यु िवशारदाः
There are many more, brave warriors who have staked their lives for me, who have many
weapons and who are experts in the science of warfare. (9)
(109) These are experts in the science of war-fare and the very images of Mantras. They have as if
become pioneers of the tradition of use of missiles.
(110) These are unequalled in the world and they are fully imbibed with valour but they have totally
staked their lives for my sake.
(111) As the heart of a faithful wife does not touch anyone other than her husband, so, for these great
warriors I am their whole and sole.
(112) They consider their life as nothing when compared to our cause. These are true devotees of
limitless loyalty.
(113) They know the skill of war, it is they who have kept the fame of science of war alive. Even the
spirit of the fighter caste, Kshatriyas, has its beginning in them.
(114) Such greatest warriors are there in our army. How can I count them? They are numberless.
अपया ं तद माक
ं बलं भी मािभरि तम्|
पया ं ि वदमेतेषां बलं भीमािभरि तम्
Our army fully protected by Bheeshma, is unconquerable while their army, guarded by Bheema is
easy to conquer. (10)
