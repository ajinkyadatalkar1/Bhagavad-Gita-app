Sanjaya said, O, the giver of trouble to enemies! Having thus spoken to Hrishikesha (Krishna)
Gudakesha (Arjuna) (again) saying to Govinda “I will not fight”, became silent. (9)
(81) Sanjaya was reporting this. He said, ‘‘O king, that Partha (Arjuna) who was again caught by
sorrow, said-
(82) With all the pathetic pangs, to Shrikrishna. “Now, please try not to persuade me! I am certainly
not going to fight here.”
(83) He spoke this in one breath and remained silent. The Lord Shrikrishna was surprised to see him
in this depressed condition.

Then O Bharata, (meaning Dhritarashtra) Hrishikesha (Krishna), as if smiling at him addressed
the following words to the sorrowful Arjuna, in his chariot between both the armies. (10)
(84) Then the Lord thought to himself - “What is this Arjuna doing? What has he allowed to enter in
his consciousness? He really does not at all know what is to be done.
(85) How is he going to understand? How will he regain his brave nature? In the same way as a
magician does not allow the ghost any scope -
(86) Or like a doctor, seeing the seriousness of illness, immediately uses apt remedy like the
divinely effective nectar in that emergency,
(87) Ananta (Shrikrishna) was about to explain, between both the standing armies, to Arjuna, in such
a way that Arjuna would drop his confusion.
(88) Holding in his mind this objective, the Lord, with a tinge of annoyance, started to speak. But his
annoyance was like an anger of a mother in which is hidden her love.
(89) That was just like the bitterness of a medicine which contains the wholesome nectar which is
not easily known but is evident by its good effect.
(90) Similarly what Hrishikesha started to speak was superficially in the tone of admonition but
inwardly very sweet in effect.
