(271) I am that time which dissolves the whole earth together with all the mountains like Meru and
Mandara, and it destroys the final ocean on the spot.
(272) It closes and extinguishes the fire of destruction, swallows the wind and, O the wearer of the
great crown! It contains the whole sky.
(273) The Playmate of Laxmi said, "I am that time which is limitless, and I am also the creator of the
