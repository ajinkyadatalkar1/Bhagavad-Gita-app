knowing, but reveals that Atmic principle which is so far hidden by
those both- such is the strange dawn of this Sun!
(16) Who is capable of seeing that Sun of knowledge who is beyond
the day and night? He is light eternal, without any object to be
illuminated by him.
(17) I offer my salutions again and again to Nivruttinath, my Guru, who
is such
a Sun of knowledge, because if I try to praise him by so many words,
I come to realize how weak is speech!
(18) The praise can be worth its name only when the object of praise
and the intellect become one, after understanding the greatness of the
God in our heart.
(19) O my Guru, you are only to be known when our awarenes of all
objects with name and form comes to an end, you can only be
experienced in the tight embrace of silence and can only be realized
by a soul who has negated himself totally.
(20) In an effort to descirbe your greatness, the speech which is
articulated, dissolves itself in the Madhyama and Pashyanti, together
with the Para Vani, which is voice of silence.
(21) To say that you may please tolerate and consider good my effort to
praise you in a prayer composed of words, by conceiving myself as
your servant, is to bring at a lower level the bliss which is in the non-
duality.
(22) But suppose a poor man sees the ocean of nectar, he becomes
confused and forgetting the propriety or otherwise of his actions, he
offers ordinary vegetables as a welcome to the ocean.
