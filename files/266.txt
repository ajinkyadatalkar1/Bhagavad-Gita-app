and existence and end.
(292) The seed grows and bears branches and again the 'treeness' is contained in the 'seed'.
Similarly everything is born from the will and in the end merges into that will.
(293) So, that "will" which is the seed of the world, as desire at the abstract level, merges again in
the "will"; and that place of final merger is myself.
(294) These names and forms end, the manifestations get dried up, the distinctions of various types
are destroyed, when there is no form at all.
(295) I am that place where all the dormant tendencies remain resting with desires and
conditionings, ready to reconstruct the sentient and insentient world.
तपा यहमहं वष िनगृ ा यु सृजािम च|
अमृतं चैव मृ यु सदस चाहमजुन
I give heat. I give rain and hold back or send forth the showers. Arjuna! I am immortality and
death, and I am Being and Non-being. (19)
(296) As the Sun, I produce heat by which water is dried up, but afterwards as Indra I give rain and
water is again filled up.
(297) When fire eats (burns) wood, the wood becomes fire. Similarly I am one who dies and one
who kills.
(298) Thus, that whichever is the object of Death and that which does not die, is my own nature.
(299) Now, you take it in summary, whatever we wish to talk in detail. The fact is I am both the
existence and non- existence.
(300) Therefore, Arjuna! Is there any place where I am not? But see the twisted destiny of the
beings! They do not see me.
(301) For examples, it is like waves being thirsty of water or rays not being able to see, if there is
no lamp and wick. So, see the wonder! They themselves are myself, but become deluded that I am
not existing.
(302) This universe is permeated by me inside and out, but see how their own karma comes in the
say! They deny my existence!
(303) But they are fools like a man who falls in a pool of nectar and with great effort tries to come
out of it. What can we speak about them?
