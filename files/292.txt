(47) Similarly the highest wisdom in the Geeta has been expounded
here by bringing all the beauty and the freshness of Marathi language
into it.
(48) The Lord of Yadavas, who is the highest teacher of all the world,
and who gives great satisfaction to the minds of the learned people in
a very wonderful way, said further to Arjuna, which please listen to.
(49) Dnyanadeva, the disciple of Nivritti, says that the Lord Shri Hari
said, "Arjuna, you are really capable by your mind to listen to the
whole presentation of self- knowledge.
शीभगवानुवाच-
भूय एव महाबाहो शृणु मे परमं वचः|
य ेऽहं पीयमाणाय व यािम िहतका यया
The Lord said, "O Arjuna, the man of powerful arms! Please listen to my supreme teaching again,
which I am going to tell you, my dear, for your own good. (1)
(50) What we told you earlier was in a way a test to see how much you are attentive, and we found
that you are not lacking in it; but you are fully attentive.
(51) In an earthen pot, we put some water and check whether it leaks and if it does not leak, we fill it
completely. Similarly you were made to hear a little and tasted to find out whether you should be
told everything and it is decided to do so.
(52) When a servant is newly appointed, a small valuable article is kept in a place wherefrom he
can easily pick it up, and if he is not enticed to steal it, then he is given the keys of the treasure-
rooms. Similarly, O Arjuna, since you have passed the test, you have earned my complete trust.
(53) Thus, the lord of all the world talked with great affection, by looking at Arjuna with love just as
a cloud becomes very kind, when it sees a mountain.
(54) In the same manner, the greatest among the kind-hearted said "O the man of powerful arms,
please listen; I am going to tell again what I have already told.
(55) Every year a field is cultivated and if it is seen that the yield is increasing, then one is not tired
of putting in more labour in the cultivation.
