There is a story of a little bird Titawi, who had laid her eggs in a
crevice of a rock on the shores of the sea. But a frog swallowed those

both Arjuna and Hanuman did not recognize him. The condition of the
bet was also such that if the pathway would not break, Hanuman would
sit on the Chariot of Arjuna, on the flag post and would help him in war.
So, now, Hanuman agreed to that condition and sat always at the post of
