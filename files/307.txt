(215) O, the bearer of curly hair on the head, O the great Lord Shankara in the matter of Archery!
Please listen- I am the Atman in each and every being.
(216) I am interiorly in their consciousness and am the exterior cover for them. I am at their end and
I am their 'Life' during their life time
(217) Just as, for the clouds, only the sky is there, in and out of them; they are born in the sky and
exist in the sky only;
(218) When they get dissolved, they remain as the sky only, so, I am the birth, the living and the
death for all the beings.
(219) Please know my state of numberlessness and the vastness by knowing these manifestations,
and for this, putting your soul in your ears, you should listen with rapt attention.
(220) O the husband of Subhadra, please listen to other manifestations which I have promised to tell
you.

Maruts, I am Mareechi, and amongst all the stars, I am the Moon (21)
(221) After saying thus, the kind god said "I am Vishnu among the Adityas and I am Ravi amongst the
brilliant, who has rays.
(222) The wielder of Sharnga bow said- "I am Marichi in the hosts of Maruts, and in the arena of the
sky, I am the Moon amongst the stars.

brother of the (fortynine) Maruts.
(224) I am mind, the eleventh sense-organ among the senses, which you should know; and among the
beings, I am their natural life force.
