(418) He, though earlier occupied in doing bad deeds, should be considered the very best; as if he
has survived the great flood and come out of it.
(419) As his 'being drowned' was false because his life is now on this bank of the stream, similarly
the devotee who is firm in his devotion at the time of death also wipes away his sins if committed
earlier in his life.
(420) Thus even if a man were wrong-doer earlier, if he bathes in the waters of repentence and
comes unto me;
(421) Now his family is pure, his ancestry is clean and the fruit of fulfillment of desires in this life,
is attained by him.
(422) It is to be so considered that he has learned everything, performed all penances and studied the
eight-fold Yoga.
(423) O Partha! Enough of this. In short, he who has unbroken faith and devotion towards me, has
really fully gone beyond all the Actions.
(424) O the warrior of great crown! He who has collected all the actions of his mind and intellect
and put them in the box of loyalty, and kept it with me with all the trust, is free!
ि पं भवित धमा मा शश्व छाि तं िनग छित|
कौ तेय पितजानीिह न मे भ ः पण यित
O Son of Kunti, he immediately becomes a religious man and attains permanent peace! I say on
oath that no devotee of mine ever perishes (31).
(425) You may perhaps think that he will be similar to me after lapse of some time, but no! How can
he who lives in nectar ever die?
(426) When the sun has not come up on the horizon, that is called night. So, is not everything done
without my devotion, surely a great sin?
(427) So, O! son of Pandu, as soon as his mind embraces me with love, he becomes united with me
and becomes my own Reality.
(428) Just as it is not possible to know which lamp is earlier, when one lamp is lighted by another
lamp, he who worships me with his heart and soul, becomes me only.
(429) Then he assumes that peace which is my peace and lustre which is my lustre; In short, he lives
with my life force.
