he has become completely fulfilled, and thus easily becomes free from the attachment to actions.
नैव त य क
ृ तेनाथ नाक
ृ तेनेह क न|
न चा य सवभूतेषु कि दथ यपाशयः
He has no use whatsoever, of anything whether done or not done. nor has he any dependence on
all beings in this world. (18)
(148) Just as the means or instruments are automatically kept aside when one has fulfilled his desires
by their use; similarly when there is self-satisfaction, there are no duties.
(149) O Arjuna, so long as that understanding does not embrace our mind, there is the necessity of
adopting this means (of duty).
त मादस ः सततं काय कम समाचर|
अस ो ाचरन् कम परमा नोित पू षः
Therefore, you should continuously do your duty which is prescribed, without being attached.
Really, only by doing duties without attachment, man attains the supreme.(19)
(150) Therefore you should control your senses and being free of all desires, keep on performing
your own duty.
(151) O Partha, those who have followed this way of non-desirous-ness in the perfor-mance of duty,
have really attained the Supreme state of aloneness in this world.
कमणैव िह संिसि माि थता जनकादयः|
लोकसंगहमेवािप संप यन् कतुमहिस
Janaka and other wise men have reached perfection through such unattached performance of
action. Seeing clearly your status in the society you have also to look after the organization of the
society to keep it in proper order. (21)
(152) Please consider this - Janaka and some others have without giving up the whole gamut of
action, attained the bliss of liberation.
(153) Therefore, O Partha, you should have interest in action. This is also likely to be helpful in
some other way.
(154) When you observe the regular code of conduct, people will also see it and follow. Thus they
will naturally be saved from the danger of downfall.
