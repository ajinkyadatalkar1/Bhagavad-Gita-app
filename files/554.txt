(361) When this Atman travels from one body to another, he feels that he is the doer and receiver of
the results of his actions.
(362) O Dhananjaya, when a man is actually living and enjoying in a place as rich as a palace, then
only, we recognise him to be a rich person.
(363) Similarly when the Atman takes up residence in a body, the concept of "I am the doer"
becomes very strong, and then there is great havoc in the various senses and their objects.
(364) If he leaves the body, he takes with him the whole caravan of the sense organs;
(365) Just as a guest when insulted takes away the spiritual merit of the host, or just as the string,
which pulls the puppets takes away their movement.
(366) Or just as the setting Sun takes away the power of vision of all the beings or just as the wind
takes away the fragrance of flowers.
(367) Similarly O Dhananjaya, the Atman who is the owner of the body takes with him the mind and
other sense organs and goes out.
शोतं च ुः पशनं च रसनं घाणमेव च|
अिध ाय मन ायं िवषयानुपसेवते
While dwelling in the senses of hearing, sight, touch, taste and smell as well as in the mind, this
Atman, (Jeeva) enjoys by proxy the objects of senses. (9)
(368) And then either in this region of death or in the heaven, whatever body he occupies, he
develops in the same body, the senses as well as the mind according to the conditions there.
(369) Dear Pandava, suppose a lamp is extinguished, it takes away its light, but if it is rekindled, it
starts giving light again. This is like that.
(370) O the crowned one, those who have insight can see this much.
(371) Because they think that everything is real, when Atman seems to have entered the body, to have
enjoyed the objects; and to have left the body and gone out.
(373) But really, Atman who is not attached to the body knows that coming, going, doing and
enjoying are all belonging to the Prakriti.
