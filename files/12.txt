offers salutations to elderly and pious personages, they usually give a
blessing ''May you have very good eight sons!'' Similarly Swamiji gave
her the same blessing. Listening to the blessing, Rukmini could not
control her laugh which was having a pathetic undertone. Swamiji asked
her, why she laughed, upon which she said, ''Sir, my husband has left me
quite sometime back with a determination to take initiation of Sanyasa''.
Being asked about the general description of her husband, she told him
some details. Swamiji somehow doubted that her husband must be his
new disciple Chaitanyashrama. Promising her that he would investigate,
and see what he could do, Swamiji left Alandi and cutting short his
travels went to Kashi. Going to his Ashrama, he met Chaitanyashrama
and asked him about his family. As the information tallied with what he
had learnt in Alandi, Shreepada-Swami ordered this disciple to treat the
initiation as not valid and to go back to his home and prosecute his
duties as a householder properly.
Vitthalpanta obeyed the orders of his Guru, and came back to Alandi
and became a householder again. After some years, the couple got four
children. The eldest was Nivritti, the second was Dnyanandeo, the third
was Sopana, and the fourth was a daughter, named Mukta. Their births
took place respectively in the years of 1268, 1271, 1274 and 1277 A.D.
At the proper ages of the sons, Vitthalpanta naturally desired that the
sons should be initiated by the ritual of wearing thread etc., but no
Brahmins were willing to conduct the ceremony. They said to
Vitthalpanta, ''You and your sons have no caste, family, class, and no
eligibility for being initiated. You are Sanyasi, and these are your sons.
A Sanyasi is not having any caste, what of being a Brahmin? In our
opinion, these children have no right to be initiated by thread ceremony.
Actually you should suffer the punishment of ending of your life! That
is the only punishment to wipe out your sin.
