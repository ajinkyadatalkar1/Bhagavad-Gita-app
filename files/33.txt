Then, seated in a glorious chariot drawn by white horses, Shri Krishna as well as Arjuna blew
their celestial conches. (14)
Shri Krishna blew his conch named Panchajanya, Arjuna, his own called conch Devdatta, while
Bheema of terrible deeds blew his mighty conch Poundra. (15)
King Yudhishthira, son of Kunti, blew his conch Anantavijaya, while Nakula and Sahadeva blew
theirs, known as Sughosha and Manipushpaka, respectively. (16)
(137) While in the heaven the conditions were so tragic, what happened in the army of Pandavas?
(138) The chariot of Arjuna was as if the essence of victory in war or the store-house of great
brilliance and there were four horses yoked to that chariot, who were as if twins of the divine
eagle in the matter of speed.
(139) That chariot was looking like a flying mountain ‘Meru’ and all the ten directions were filled
with its great light.
(140) The God Narayana who is the King of Vaikuntha was the charioteer to control its horses. How
can I describe the quality of that chariot sufficiently!
(141) The monkey Hanuman on the flag was the very image of Lord Shankara; and Lord Shri Krishna
(the holder of the bow Sharnga), was the driver.
(142) See the great, wonderful love of God for His devotee, evinced by His doing the duty of a
charioteer for Partha (Arjuna).
(143) He kept his servant at the back and Himself remained in front. He blew his conch Panchajanya
easily.
(144) But the sound of that conch was so great that just as the stars disappear when the Sun rises;
(145) So by this sound, the great tumult of drums of war in the army of Kauravas became inaudible,
beyond recognition.
(146) Similarly the great archer, Arjuna blew his conch called Devdatta, the sound of which was
very deep and vibrating.
