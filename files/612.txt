Thus in the Upanishads sung by the Lord, in the science of the knowledge of Brahman, in the
scripture of Yoga and in the dialogue between the Lord Shrikrishna and Arjuna, the sixteenth chapter
by name the Yoga of the Division of Divine and the Demonic qualities, comes to an end.

Chapter - 17
The Yoga of the Three Kinds of Faith
(1) O my teacher, you are like the Lord Ganesha, and in the
experiencing of the trance taught by you, which is just like the yogic
sleep, the hold of the exterior universal perception on the
consciousness of a Jeeva is slackened, I bow before you!
(2) The three modifications as the Sattwa, the Rajas and the Tamas are
like the city of Tripura, in which the soul who is like Lord Shiva, is
caught in the castle of his soul-hood, but by remembering your name,
the soul or the Atman, as Lord Shiva is released from that bondage.
(3) Put in a weighing scale with the Lord Shiva, you are thus heavier in
the role of a Guru, but light enough to be the "float" on the sea of
Maya to ferry the seekers to the other shore.
(4) You are the destroyer of the "twisted" for those who are ignorant
about you, but for the wise people, you are completely straight-
forward. (Vakratunda is the name of Lord Ganesha, which has one
meaning that "He is having twisted mouth", and the other meaning is,
"He is the destroyer (Tunda) of the twisted (Vakra)."
(5) Your divine eyes appear to be very small but you are capable of
creating the whole universe and destroying it by the mere opening
and closing of your eyelids.
