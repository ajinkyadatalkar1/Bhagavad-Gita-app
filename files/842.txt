invoked Lord Vishnu to protect him. The Lord saw that Durwasa had
not only cursed but created a female demon to harass the king. The Lord
came and destroyed her by his Sudarshana disc, which having killed that
demon-woman, began to run after Durwasa in order to kill him. Durwasa
surrendered to Ambereesha and the Lord, after one year of hunt. Then
the king dined with the Sage Durwasa, thus his penance of fast was
properly accomplished. Then in order that the word of a Sage like
Durwasa should not go waste, and the king Ambareesha should not be
compelled to take births ten times in various categories, the Lord
himself decided to take so many Avataras.
This story also tells how great is the sacrifice done by the Lord for his
devotees.

"I pulled you out of the burning house''.
Here Krishna is referring to the calamity which Pandavas had to face
when the palace which was given for their residence in their visit to
Waranawata, by Kuru Hero, Duryodhana, was burnt down by him by
indirect instructions. Krishna and Vidura had saved Pandavas from the
palace by directing them to use a tunnel leading to a far away place from
the burning house.
(38) Chapter 11. Ovi - 62.
Hiranyaksha was adamant.
This verse refers to Hiranyaksha who was enemy of Lord Vishnu; who
died and became spiritually merged into the Lord's consciousness,
through his acute hatred emotional power attaching itself to the Lord.
Devotion also takes place when a man hates God very earnestly.
