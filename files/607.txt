more than crores of Kalpas!
(413) And this is the first step only towards the ghastly and hideous places of torture where they are
to go later on. How can they escape fiercer frustrations later on?
आसुर योिनमाप ना मूढा ज मिन ज मिन|
मामपा यैव कौ तेय ततो या यधमां गितम्
O the son of Kunti, those foolish people take births after births in such evil conditions and
categories and go further and further down, without any chance to reach me! (20)
(414) Thus by the demonic vices they fall to such deep detestable conditions.
(415) But in a way, in the life of a tiger or other wild animals, they can get some rest from time to
time for their bodies and can relax.
(416) Then I throw them in such dark conditions of total blackness of ignorance, which if applied to
dark colour, that colour will become more pitch black!
(417) They are the lowest of the lowly people in whose case, the sins get disgusted, hells get
nauseated, suffering also becomes unconscious by their sight.
(418) Dirt becomes dirty by their touch, the fever becomes feverish, and the great fear becomes
itself afraid of them.,
(419) The sins become bored by them, unauspicious things become more aggravated by their contact,
an infection gets contaminated by their vicinity and becomes afraid of being more virulent.
(420) O Dhananjaya, by reaching such very deplorable conditions in the lowest categories of life,
they become the Tamas Quality personified.
(421) Alas! How worst hellish conditions have they created and suffered! The speech stammers
while trying to describe their misery, the mind is warped and withered to consider all this.
(422) It cannot be sanely imagined why these people thrive in such evil vices by which their whole
life is destroyed so pitiably!
(423) Therefore, O the great archer! You should never turn towards the places where these demon-
like villains live.
(424) And should not step in the situations where the hypocrisy and other five vices earlier
described are prevalent.
