(248) Just as a cow which has some disease of udder, does not give milk eventhough it has given a
calf or just as the field which has been grazed by animals while it is half ready with growth, does
not yield crop.
(249) Similarly that penace which is performed with a big pomp and show becomes useless and
fruitless;
(250) And O the son of Pandu, when the man sees that this penance is useless, he gives it up and
therefore, there is no consistency in it.
(251) For example, a cloud which has appeared in the sky out of season may thunder and fill the
whole world with its echo, but will it remain so even for an hour?
(252) Similarly the penance which is Rajasic not only proves to be fruitless, but it is not even
completed.
(253) Now if that penance is Tamasic, when it is performed, the man loses both the happiness in
heaven and the fame in this world.
मूढगाहेणा मनो यत् पीडया िकयते तपः|
पर यो सादनाथ वा त ामसमुदा तम्
The penance which is performed involving suffering to oneself, with adamant foolish
determination or with a motive to oust others is called Tamas penance. (19)
(254) O the great archer, when by being obsessed by stupidity our body is considered as our enemy..
(255) And that body is subjected to five types of fire, and such articles are eaten which produce
burning like fire inside the body,.
(256) They burn insense on their head, prick and poke their back with sharp hooks or they sit in a
circle of fire and scorch their body.
(257) By withholding breath they punish themselves and observe severe fast without reason and get
themselves hung with their heads down and breathe smoke from burning artcles below on the
ground!
