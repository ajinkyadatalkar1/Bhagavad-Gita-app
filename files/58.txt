(111) There is only one reason for this ignorance. The man becomes a slave to his sense-organs, and
they occupy the mind and thus he is confused.
(112) The sense-organs come into contact with their objects and pleasure and
pain come into existence there. By this contact, they overcome the inner consciousness.
(113) There is no fixed quality or anything permanent in the nature of these objects. These are

O, the great purusha (Arjuna), the brave man to whom pain and pleasure are alike, and who is not
tormented by these contacts, becomes eligible for immortality. (15)
(123) He whom these objects do not affect, does not suffer both from pain or pleasure and he has not
