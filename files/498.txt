his buttocks.
(106) Such a strange child was born to the root Maya, and the chubbiness of that child is the vast
spread out of the three worlds.
(107) The eighty-four lakhs of categories of creatures are the various joints of the bones in his body.
Then this child gradually began to grow.
(108) This root-Maya started to put ornaments of various names and shapes on this child and to feed
it every day with a new kind of milk of ignorance.
(109) She put various rings of creation on the fingers of this child. The lustre of each such ring is
quite unique.
(110) Thus by delivering this only child consisting of the whole animate and inanimate universe, the
Maya began to congratulate herself, for her fullness.
(111) Brahma the creator is the morning of this child, the lord Vishnu is the noon and the Lord
Shankara is the evening.
(112) This child having played to its mind's satisfaction, goes to sleep on the bed of the great deluge
and when the new Kalpa or the creation is to begin, it wakes up by wrong type of knowledge or
confusion.
(113) Dear Arjuna, thus in the house of ignorance and illusion, this child begins to take faltering
steps of Ages after Ages.
(114) This child whose friend is the concepts and counter doubts, while ego is his playmate, come to
its death only by knowledge of truth.
(115) But enough of this lengthy allegory. Maya has in this way created this universe and my power
was useful to her in that project.
सवयोिनषु कौ तेय मूतयः संभवि त याः|
तासां ब मह ोिनरहं बीजपदः िपता
O the son of Kunti, Brahman is the big place of birth of every manifestation in all the streams of
life and I am the father, who provides the seed. (4)
(116) O the son Pandu, I am therefore the father, the root-Maya ‘Mahat’ is the mother and this
apparent world is our child.
(117) Now do not be misguided by seeing these various bodies in this world because all the beings
including the mind, the intellect and other manifestations are essentially one only.
