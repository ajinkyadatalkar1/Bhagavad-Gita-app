sound ‘M’. In the divine body of Shri Ganesha, the A (or अ) forms
the two feet, u or उforms the big stomach and M or म denotes the
great orb of his head.
(20) All the three become unified with each other and thus Brahman in
the form of WORD ॐ becomes manifest, to which, by the grace and
the blessing of my Guru, I have bowed down.
(21) Now I have bowed down to Goddess Sharada, who plays with
novel, ever new speech, who is the damsel as the very image of
cleverness and Arts, and who enchants the whole universe.
(22) In my heart Sadguru dwells and because of him I have transcended
the flood of this worldly life, and therefore I have more respect for
discrimination.
(23) When we put some Anjana (ointment) in our eyes, our vision
becomes clairvoyant and great treasures become visible wherever we
look.
(24) Or when the gem Chintamani is found by us, we are always
successful in achieving what our mind imagines. Thus, by the grace
of My Guru Nivrutti I have become one whose all desires are fulfilled
- so says Dnyandeva.
(25) Therefore, a man who is wise in his discrimination, should serve
the preceptor, and thus become entirely accomplished, just as by
sprinkling water at the roots of a tree, the branches and the leaves get
satisfactory nourishment.
(26) Or, by taking bath in an ocean, the merit of bathing in all the
sacred places of the three worlds is earned, or in tasting the nectar,
we have virtually tasted all the juices in the world.
