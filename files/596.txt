पवृि ं च िनवृि ं च जना न िवदुरासुराः|
न शौचं नािप चाचारो न स यं तेषु िव ते
The demonic people do not know what it means to be active positively in the right action, or what
is the nature of withdrawing from outer activity. There is no sense of purity of cleanliness nor proper
following of good code of conduct in them. Truth has no place in their life. (7)
(281) In their mind there is dark night of ignorance regarding positive attitude about good deeds and
avoidance of sins.
(282) They have no knowledge how to be free and how a man gets involved, just like the silkworm
asleep in its pupae.
(283) Or, they are as stupid as a fool who gives money to a robber, without caring whether that
money will be received back from him or not.
(284) Similarly, the people with the domonic vice in them, do not know whether to do a certain thing
or not to do it, and they do not see what is cleanliness, even in their dream.
(285) Perhaps a coal may be free of its black, a crow may look fair, or a monster may be tired of
eating flesh.
(286) But, O Dhananjaya, the demon-like peple have no cleanliness, just as a pot of wine is never
clean.
(287) They have no thought about performance of rites and rituals, have no respect for their
forefathers and do not care for proper action.
(288) Just as a she-goat goes on grazing or the wind blows continuously or the fire simply goes on
burning things;
(289) Similarly these persons behave without any inhibition or check, and they have enmity with
truth at all times.
(290) If a scorpion will ever tickle instead of biting with its sting, if that is at all possible, then only
one can expect these people to speak truth.
(291) If the intestinal gas will ever give good fragrance from its farting, then only these demons will
have an iota of truth in them.
(292) Even if they do not actually do any evil things, by nature itself they are falsifiers. Now I will
tell you the strangeness of their talk.
