समोऽहं सवभूतेषु न मे े योऽि त न िपयः|
ये भजि त तु मां भ या मिय ते तेषु चा यहम्
I am equal to all. I hate nobody and nobody is dear to me, but in the case of those who worship
me with devotion, they are in me and I am in them.
(407) And if you ask me what is my Reality, I am the same to all the beings where there is no sense

Even if a man is doing a work of lowliest cadre and still he worships me with one-pointed
devotion, he should be considered a sage, because his mind is rightly attentive to me (30)
(415) Even the physical body of such a devotee does not hinder him may he belong to any caste.
(416) And if we look at his daily conduct, O, great warrior, it is the classic example of evil deeds,
but he has sold his body in the market square of devotion!
(417) My dear, a man goes to subtler worlds exactly in accordance with what his mind thinks at the
