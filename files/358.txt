(441) My Lord, you are one Atman pervading all the universe (including us). So then, why should
you be "death" for us?
(442) Since such is the calamitous emergency, I have already lost all hopes of my life, and I request
you that you should also say without hesitation whatever is in your mind.
(443) My Lord, how far are you going to stretch your angry and fierce form? Remember your duty of
