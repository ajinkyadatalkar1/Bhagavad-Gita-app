शी भगवानुवाच-
ह त ते कथिय यािम िद या ा मिवभूतयः|
पाधा यतः क
ु शे ना य तो िव तर य मे
The Lord said, "O the great one of Kurus! Lo! I shall tell you the most important of my own divine
manifestations, as there is no end to my expansion. (19)
(206) Forgetting that he is the father of the grand-father Brahmadeva, Shrikrishna said, "O my dear
son of Pandu, you have talked well."
(207) We have no reason to be surprised by Shrikrishna's addressing Arjuna as "my dear" Or "son of
Pandu" because, was he himself not the son of Nanda, the cow herd?
(208) These words were expressed because of his extreme love for Arjuna. But let it be. He said
further "O the wielder of great bow! Please listen to what I am going to tell.
(209) "So, O the husband of Subhandra, you have asked about my manifestations. But they are
infinite. They are, no doubt, my own. But I cannot fully enumerate them with the power of my
intellect.
(210) A man cannot count the hair on his own body. Similarly my own manifestations are not
countable by me.
(211) I am not aware how great I am myself and in what manner, and, therefore, only the most
significant manifestations will be told, to which you please listen.
(212) O the wieder of a great crown! When you know these, all of them will be known by you, just
as by holding a seed in our hand, we as if hold the whole tree.
(213) Or, when we own the garden itself, automatically the flowers and the fruit are also ours.
Similarly when these forms are seen, it is equal to having seen the whole universe.
(214) Otherwise, O! The weilder of the great bow, there is no limit to my expanse or vastness. The
vastness of the sky can hide within me!
अहमा मा गुडाक
े श सवभूताशयि थतः|
अहमािद म यं च भूतानाम त एव च
O the controller of sleep! (Arjuna), I am the Atman dwelling within all the beings and I am the
beginning, the central existence and the end of all beings (20).
