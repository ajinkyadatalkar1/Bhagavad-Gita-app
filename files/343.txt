and the heaven.
(260) My Lord, I am seeing in your body, many groups of five elements each and every group of
variety of beings.
(261) My Lord, the Satyaloka is also visible in your body, and there is the God Brahma, is it not?
And also if I look in other direction, there is Kailas!
(262) The Lord Mahadev with his spouse Bhavani is being seen by me in one side, and I am also
seeing you, O Hrisshikesh, in your own body.
(263) The families of Kashyapa and other sages are all visible in this form and I am seeing the
nether-worlds together with the reptiles.
(264) O the Lord of the three worlds! On the wall of each of your limb, I see the fourteen worlds
drawn like pictures.
(265) And all the worlds and the beings are also, as if painted! Such is your extra-ordinary greatness
which I see.
अनेकबाहदरव नेतं प यािम वां सवतोऽन त पम्|
ना तं न म यं न पुन तवािदं प यािम िव े र िव प
I am seeing, O the Lord of the universe and 'identical with the universe' many arms, stomach,
mouths, and eyes of your immeasurable form spread everywhere, and I am not able to see the end, the
existence as also the beginning. (16)
(266) When I see by my divine sight everywhere, I see the sky filled with all your arms like its
sprouts.
(267) In this way, My Lord, I see all your arms acting variously everywhere at one and the same
time.
(268) And I see your stomachs and feel that they are deep and capacious store-houses of worlds
become manifest from the abstract Brahman.
(269) Sir, I see that in this form at one single time, there are crores of editions of the universal
Purusha of one thousand heads, and they appear as if they are thousands of fruits on the tree of the
absolute Brahman by the weight of which it is bending down.
(270) I also see all your faces, O the God of universal image! I also see rows and rows of your eyes.
(271) Not only this, but the distinction of heaven, earth, directions, sky or the nether-world has
dissolved itself because everything is one whole existence.
