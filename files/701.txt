(161) Just as a thirsty man in a desert may luckily get nectar in the very hot winds there, or just as a
blind man may get the light of the Sun in his blind eyes.
(162) Or, just as the river itself comes rushing to save a drowning man, or death himself may give
extension of life to a dying man;
(163) Similarly, O the son of Pandu, the very action releases the seekers of freedom from the
bondage of action. This is like a poison saving a man who may be dying due to taking a medicine!
(164) O Arjuna, such is the power of these actions which themselves become instrumental to destroy
the bondage.
(165) Now, O the crowned one! I shall tell you the skill by which action itself nullifies 'binding'
action.
एता यिप तु कमािण संगं य वा फलािन च|
कत यानीित मे पाथ िनि तं मतमु मम्
Even these actions, O Partha, should be done without having attachment to them or desire for their
fruits. This in my best and definite opinion. (6)
(166) You see, even if greater ceremonies of sacrifices are being performed, the pride of being a
Doer should not be there.
(167) It is like a man who goes to a pilgrimage by others' cost, does not feel that he is doing
pilgrimage.
(168) If a servant catches a king by the orders of a more powerful person, that servant cannot be
proud that he is the victor.
(169) A person who crosses the waters by the help of an expert swimmer, does not become proud
that he is a good swimmer and when a priest only acts like an appointed man to give any sum in
charity on behalf of an employer, he cannot boast that he is the generous giver of charity.
(170) Similarly, without any sense of pride of an "Actor", actions of all these sorts should be
maintained or sponsored.
(171) And O Pandava, the aspiration should not be allowed to turn towards the results that would be
naturally coming out of these.
(172) For this, hope for the fruit should first be dropped away and then action should be undertaken.
It is like a lady who breast- feeds baby of another woman. (Wet-nurse).
