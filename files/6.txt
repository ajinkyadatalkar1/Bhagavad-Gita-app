The Earth asked the Lord Vishnu -
(1) O God, The Supreme Lord! O Master! How can anybody who is
undergoing the results of his past actions in this worldly life ever be a
totally loyal devotee?
The Lord Vishnu answered -
(2) When a man who is enjoying the results of his past actions, is
constantly merged into the study of Geeta, becomes free; he is happy
and he is not affected by actions and their results in this worldly life.
(3) If he meditates on Geeta, no sins including the greatest ones, will
touch him, just as water does not adhere to the lotus-leaf.
(4) In a place where the book of Geeta is kept respectfully and is
regularly recited, there, all the Teerthas (sacred places) like Prayaga,
etc. come to reside.
(5) Where the Geeta is studied regularly, there come to live all gods,
sages, yogis, serpents of divine nature, the young friends of
Shrikrishna, who were cowherds, maidens from Gokula, Narada,
Uddhava together with the personal attendants of Lord Vishnu and
they immediately help the devotees.
(6) Then, O Earth, I am definitely residing constantly at the place where
there are discussions on the philosophy contained in Geeta, where its
recitation, and its teaching to others to recite verbally is going on and
where people listen to it.
(7) I live with the basic support of Geeta, for my actions; Geeta is my
best home, and I protect and look after all the three worlds by using
the wisdom which I have propounded in Geeta.
