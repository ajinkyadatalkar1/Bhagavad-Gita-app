(471) O Partha, you should, therefore, understand that there is no shortage of paths by which people
can reach me and enter into me.
(472) Thus a man may have been born in any caste, he may worship me or directly hate me, he may
be a devotee or an enemy - he should be occupied with me only.
(473) Thus by whatever cause, when a man feels that he belongs to me, it should be then clearly
understood that he has attained unity with my Reality.
(474) O Arjuna, therefore, I say that anyone, may he be born in sinners' family or be a merchant, a
Shoodra or a woman, if he worships me, he comes to my abode.

Then what of Brahmins or meritorious devotees and saintly kings? Considering this world as
temporary and devoid of happiness, you should worship me. (33)
(475) Then those who are entitled to royal umbrella and feathered fans among all castes, those to
whom, heaven is given as a gift, and those Brahmins who are the maternal home for the science of
charms and sacred mantras;
(476) Those who are gods on the earth; those who are embodiments of penance, and those who are
the newly arisen good fortune for all the sacred places;
(477) Those who are the permanent abodes of Yadnyas, those who are proud of Vedas and those on
the lap of whose blissful sight, auspicious qualities thrive,
(478) Those by whose interestedness, good actions are spread everywhere, and by whose will the
truth has survived;
(479) Those like the sage Ourwa, by whose will, fire was born, and by whose orders the sea held
the fire within it; giving its water for controlling it;
(480) Those like the sage Bhrugu to serve whom I left aside goddess Laxmi and in order to avoid
hardness of touch to whose feet, I removed the 'Kaustubha' diamond and kept ready my chest for
his kick!
(481) That imprint of whose foot I still keep on my chest, O, the auspicious Arjuna, with a view to
keep up the good name and fame of my peaceful mind;
(482) Those in whose anger fire resides all the time, the fire of all-devouring Rudra; and in whose
blessing, the eight greater occult powers abide;
