to take birth again.
(124) O, Partha, he is of the quality of permanency and he should be recognized by his not being
affected by the objects of the senses.
नासतो िव ते भावो नाभावो िव ते सतः|
उभयोरिप ो त वनयो त वदिशिभः
The unreal has no existence and the real never ceases to exist; The reality of both has been
understood by the seers of the truth. (16)
(125) Now, O Arjun, I will tell you something which is known by the sane thinkers. Please listen.
(126) In all these beings and the objects, there is spirit hidden which the wise saints see and accept.
(127) It is like milk which is mixed in water and the swan separates the milk from water.
(128) Or intelligent (goldsmiths) burn the dross in the fire and obtain the pure gold.
(129) Or like the skillful churning of curds in the pot, which results in the gain of butter in the end.
(130) Or the grain and the husk are together but by sifting, we come to know how the husk is thrown
off.
(131) Similarly, this worldly life does not stand to keen investigation by thought and for the men of
wisdom, what remains is the grain or the truth.
(132) Therefore, they have no regard for whatever is temporary. They have finally understood the
nature of both the unreal and the real.
अिवनािश तु ति ि येन सविमदं ततम्|
िवनाशम यय या य न कि कतुमहित
Know ‘That’ alone to be imperishable which pervades this universe. No one has power to
destroy this indestructible substance. (17)
(133) When we consider what is essential and unessential, we come to know that, that which is
permanent is essential and that which is moving and impermanent is unessential.
(134) ‘That’, from which the whole expanse of the three worlds has come into existence has no
name, colour and shape.
(135) It is always all-pervading and without birth and death. It cannot be destroyed even if so tried.
