(147) These are all the aspirants for liberation, who are practising the path of sacrifice and have
washed away the sins from the mind, by sacrifice.
(148) When all the ignorance is burnt, there remains the pure existence, in which fire and the
performer of the sacrifices, are not separate.
(149) In that state, the desire of the person performing the sacrifice is fulfilled, the performance
comes to an end and afterwards all the actions are no more.
(150) Thought cannot enter it, there is no place for any aim and it is not touched by the blemish of
sense of duality.
य िश ामृतभुजो याि त ब सनातनम्|
नायं लोकोऽ यय य क
ु तोऽ यः क
ु स म
O! The greatest of the Kurus, yogis who enjoy the nectar-like food that is the remnant of sacrifice
attain the eternal Brahman. To the man who does not perform sacrifice, there is no happiness in this
world itself. How can he be happy in the other world? (31)
(151) Those who have great faith in Brahman, follow the meditation in which they concentrate on the
Mantra - “I AM BRAHMAN,” and partake of the self-knowledge which is the eternal, pure,
beginningless residue of sacrifice.
(152) Those who have thus attained satisfaction by receiving this residual nectar, reach the deathless
state and become Brahman effortlessly.
(153) Others who, having been born here, do not serve the fire of self-control consisting of
concentration, meditation and contemplation (संयम), who do not practise the
sacrifice in the form of yoga, are not wedded to desirelessness.
(154) O! The son of Pandu, why ask about the welfare in the other
world of the man who is not successful even in this world? We
should not talk about them?
एवं बहिवधा य ा िवतता ब णो मुखे |
कमजाि वि ता सवानेवं ा वा िवमो यसे
Many such forms of sacrifice are set forth in detail through the mouth of Brahman which is Veda;
you should know them to be involving the action, born out of the wheel of universal action. Thus
knowing their true nature, you shall be liberated from the bondage of action. (32)
