न तु मां श यसे द मनेनैव वच ुषा|
िद यं ददािम ते च ुः प य मे योगमै रम्
But you will not be able to see me, only with these your own eyes. I will give you divine vision.
See the glory of my Godly Yoga. (8)
(154) Then Lord Shrikrishna said to himself- "The eagerness in this Arjuna's mind is not yet abated.
He has not yet got the joy of Atman! He has no capacity to grasp the real universal form."
(155) Saying thus to himself, the Lord smiled and said to him who wanted to see, ‘‘My dear, I have
shown you my real universal form but you have not been seeing it.’’
(156) On this, Arjuna smartly said, ‘‘Sir, who is to be blamed for this? You are trying to feed the
crane with moonlight!’’
(157) Sir, you are holding a mirror cleansed carefully, in front of a blind man, or my Lord, you are
singing in front of a deaf person!
(158) It is like feeding small drops of nectar to a frog and waste them. Therefore, why should you
blame others?
(159) You have placed before my physical eyes that scene which is definitely only for vision beyond
sense-organs, and only meant for being seen by the eyes of the psyche.
(160) But it is not proper for me to find fault with you. It is better for me to keep quiet." Upon this,
the Lord Shri Krishna said, "You are right, my dear!"
(161) It is true that if we wish to show the universal form we should give you the capacity to see; but
in the flow of my talk I forgot!
(162) What has happened is that, seeds are sown without proper preparation of the soil. All right.
Now please see. I will give you the necessary vision.
(163) Then, O Pandava, with the help of that vision, you should enjoy the glory of seeing the
universal form so that you will surely merge into the bliss of Atman.
(164) Thus spake the Lord Shri Krishna, whom Vedas try to understand, and who is the root seed of
all the universe.
