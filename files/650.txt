of your intimacy is that one who is so closely related to you, loses all
the sense of relationship which is implied in the world of duality.
(10) Another riddle is that, you are called the brother of all the world
(Bandhu), but actually you destroy all the bondage (Bandha) and yet
there is the 'joy' in the mind of the devotee suddenly getting himself
attached to you.
(11) But O Lord, when the duality is totally dissolved the devotee is not
aware of his separate body.
(12) But those who imagine you to be separate from them and try to
reach you as a final goal through the practice of Yoga etc., find that
you are quite at a distance from them and left unnoticed!
(13) You are not caught in the field of meditation of those, who try to
concentrate upon you in their minds, but for him who even forgets to
meditate upon you because of the arising of complete unity in him,
you are the most beloved of all.
(14) He who does not know that you are a completely self-sufficient
totality, proudly totes his omniscience, but how can you listen to his
babble? Because Vedas who are so talkative, do not get any hearing
from you. (Vedas are not able to describe god (properly).
(15) 'SILENCE' is your name according to your zodiacal sign; then how
can one think of praising you? This is because when in whatever
form, you are visible, it is nothing but delusion, where is the scope
for any devotion to be offered to you?
(16) If I try to conceive myself as your servant, by that very act I become
accused of the crime of imposing a duality between us. Therefore it is
best not to do anything about you.
