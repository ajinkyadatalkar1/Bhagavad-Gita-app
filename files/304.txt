(184) Similarly, there are Gurus everywhere, but O krishna, you alone are our anchor! Let it be!
Please tell us your manifestations.
व ु मह यशेषेण िद या ा मिवभूतयः|
यािभिवभूितिभल कािनमां वं या य ित िस
You will please tell me all your divine manifestations with which you are permeating all these
worlds and still remaining as you are. (16)
(185) Sir, please show me all the manifestations of yours which are the divinely occupying divine
forces, in this way-
(186) Which are most important and with which, O Ananta, you are filling these worlds.
कथं िव ामहं योिगं वां सदा प रिच तयन्|
क
े षु क
े षु च भावेषु िच योऽिस भगव मया
How can I know you O Yogi, while thinking about you, and O Lord, in what things am I to think
and meditate upon you? (17)
(187) O, how should I know you? In what way should I meditate upon you? Because if I say that you
are ‘ALL’, then meditation is not possible.
(188) Therefore, as you have told me your manifestations in short earlier, please tell me again those,
in detail.
(189) Please explain your Yogic manifestation in such a way that I will not find it difficult to
medidate upon you in that form.
िव तरे णा मनो योगं िवभूितं च जनादन|
भूयः कथय तृि िह शृ वतो नाि त मेऽमृतम्
O Janardana, again tell me your yogic power and manifestations in details. I am not fully satisfied
while listening to your nectar - like speech. (18)
(190) And O, the Lord of all beings, please tell me those manifestations also which I have asked for
and which you have earlier told. Please do not say, "Why should one repeat those again?"
(191) Please do not let that doubt, O Janardana, touch your mind because even ordinary nectar is not
refused by anybody.
(192) And of what value is that nectar? It is the brother of great poison Kalakoota. Gods being afraid
