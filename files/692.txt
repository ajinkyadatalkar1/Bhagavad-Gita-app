to count their smell, we have not to count two by using another
finger. The unity in diversity
of these verses and the chapters should be considered similar to the
above examples.
(58) Geeta has seven hundred verses grouped into eighteen chapters.
That is the numerical count, but the theme on which the Lord
Shrikrishna dwells is one throughout.
(59) And I have also made the meaning of the whole work clear,
keeping in mind this fact. I will explain. Please listen.
(60) In the last verse of the seventeenth chapter, the Lord has said that -
(61) "O Arjuna, whatever actions are performed without having faith in
the name of Brahman which is OM TAT SAT, are all untrue."
(62) Listening to this statement of the Lord, a thought peeped into the
mind of Arjuna that "It seems, the Lord is finding fault with the men
performing various actions."
(63) "But", he thought, "The doer, the Jeeva, the poor soul is blind by
his ignorance. He does not know the nature of God at all. How can he
go further and find out the truth about this Name?
(64) Further, so long as the Rajas and Tamas in his character are not
gone, his faith is bound to be of a lesser quality. How can that faith
be able to grasp the importance of the sacred Name of Brahman?
(65) So, just as it is deadly to embrace a sword or to run on a stretched
rope or to play with a serpent,
(66) Similarly, all these actions are very dangerous and many calamities
like continuous chain of births and deaths are lurking in them.
