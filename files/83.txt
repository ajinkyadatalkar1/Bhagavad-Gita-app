या िनशा सवभूतानां त यां जागित संयमी|
य यां जागित भूतािन सा िनशा प यतो मुनेः
In the state of sleep for all ordinary beings, a man who sees divine design is very much awake,
with all senses held in check; and for a SEER all those things for which ordinary beings are very
alertly awake, is a state of sleep or of inaction. (69)
(355) He for whom the state of sleep for all the beings is the dawn of awakening and who is asleep
when all the beings are active, in the changing worldly affairs -
(356) - O Arjuna, he alone is free of all attributes and of a steady intellect. He is the great sage
having no limitations.
आपूयमाणमचलपित ं समुदमापः पिवशि त य त्|
त कामा यं पिवशि त सव स शाि तमा नोित न कामकामी
As the sea which is being filled by waters of rivers entering into it, remains ever steady, so , he in
whom all desires enter but who remains steady, attains peace and not one who runs to fulfill his
desires. (70)
(357) O Partha, in one other way he can be recognised. His mind is as undisturbed as the
peacefulness of the sea, which is undisturbed–
(358) Though all the rivers meet the ocean with all their fullness, the sea does not become larger,
and does not go beyond its limits.
(359) In the hot season, rivers are all dried up; but, O Partha, the sea does not become smaller.
(360) Similarly this man does not get disturbed in his intellect though he gains riches and attains
occult powers, nor is he affected by loss of patience if he does not get them.
(361) Please tell - Is the light in the house of the Sun, lit because of a wick which is lighted and will
he be drowned in darkness if the wick is not lighted?
(362) Similarly, you see, this person does not care if prosperity or occult powers come and go. He
is always enjoying the great inner bliss.
(363) How can he for whom even the palace of Indra is not worth comparing with the beauty of his
own house, ever be attracted by a hut of leaves, constructed by a Bhilla? (Hunter of aborigin
tribe)
