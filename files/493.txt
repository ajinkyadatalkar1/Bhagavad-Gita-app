Vaikuntha intends to tell.
(39) He said, "O Arjuna, by collecting all the "army" of attention
together you should come into direct contact with this knowledge.
(40) We have shown this to you earlier in various ways but it seems that
your mind is not yet experiencing this actually.
शीभगवानुवाच -
परं भूयः पव यािम ानानां ानमु मम्|
य ा वा मुनयः सव परां िसि िमतो गताः
The Lord said - "I shall repeat this knowledge which is the highest of all knowledges, having
attained which all the sages' have gone from this world, to the supreme state of fulfilment. (1)
(41) (The Lord said)- Therefore, now that knowledge will further be told to you which has been
declared with praise, as the higher knowledge, by Vedas also.
(42) Actually this is the knowledge of ourselves only, but as we are being much attached to the
knowledge about this world and the other world, this knowledge has become a 'higher'
knowledge or the knowledge of the 'other' category!
(43) And we say that this knowledge is surely the highest, because it burns down like a fire all that
grass of mundane knowledge.
(44) Those branches of knowledge in which people think that this world and the heaven world are
real, sacrifice is the only good action and the duality seems to be true. Because of their analytical
attitude which sees the differences in everything,–
(45) It becomes false by this knowledge like a dream, or like the wind becoming merged into the
sky.
(46) Or like the light of Moon etc. fading at sunrise, or the rivers being merged in the great waters of
final deluge.
(47) O Dhananjaya, this knowledge is the highest because, when this knowledge arises in our mind
all other knowledge disappears into oblivion!
(48) O the son of Pandu, by this knowledge we regain the freedom which is beginningless and which
is our own inheritance!
