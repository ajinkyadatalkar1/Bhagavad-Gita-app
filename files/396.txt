(161) And if in addition to this, an affectionate listener is there, then how can we get a worthy scale
to weigh the love?
(162) Therefore, Arjuna I must tell you that you are that dear devotee and you yourself are the
listener; and I luckily got a chance to describe the love of my devotee.
(163) And see! While talking on this subject I am completely engrossed in the joy of describing!"-
So saying, the Lord began to nod in the loving mood.
