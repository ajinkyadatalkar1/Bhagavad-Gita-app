nutshell.”
(127) Those who think that they are only body, and think that objects are to be enjoyed only, and do
not remember anything beyond this,
(128) And do not know the secret of this sacrifice and are eager to enjoy by this bodily attachment.
(129) And prepare food to satisfy their senses, should be known to be sinners and eating sin only.
(130) This whole prosperous stock of our possessions should be considered as “offering” and
should be sacrificed to the primordial Purusha, the God, by way of performance of our true and
proper duty.
(131) Foolish people, you see, lose this great opportunity, who prepare food of various kinds only
for themselves.
(132) I say this because food is not an ordinary eatable! By this, one achieves the complete merit of
sacrifice and also gives satisfaction to the Supreme God.
(133) The food should not be considered an ordinary thing; It is Brahman, it is the cause of life of
this whole universe.
अ ना वि त भूतािन पज याद नसंभवः|
य ाद् भवित पज यो य ः कमसमु वः
कम ब ो वं िवि ब ा रसमु वम्|
त मा सवगतं ब िन यं य े पिति तम्
All beings come into existence from food; food is produced by rain; rain is caused by sacrifice
and sacrifice is possible through prescribed action. (14)
Know that the prescribed action has its origin in the Brahman, and Brahman comes into being
from the Akshara,- the indestructible infinite Principle! Hence the all– pervading infinite is always
present in the sacrifice (of doing our duty). (15)
(134) All the beings are nourished because of food, and rain creates the food everywhere.
(135) That rain is born of sacrifice. “Action” makes the sacrifice manifest, and for action, the
Brahman identified as Vedas, is the beginning.
(136) The Vedas are born out of the Indestructible, which is far beyond; and thus all this animate and
inanimate universe is composed of Brahman.
