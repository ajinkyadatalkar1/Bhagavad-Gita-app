weapons against these.
(48) O God, to aim our sharp arrows on the hearts of these elders and then enjoy the pleasures
smeared by their blood,
(49) Is an idea totally not acceptable to me because what have we to do with such pleasures? How
can those enjoyments please me?"
(50) So in this way, Arjuna asked Shrikrishna and further asked whether he has understood, but the
Lord Shrikrishna did not agree eventhough he had heard.
(51) Seeing this, Arjuna was a little afraid but again started to say “What is the reason of Lord
Shrikrishna not listening to what I talk?”
न चैति ः कतर नो गरीयो|
य ा जयेम यिद वा नो जयेयुः
यानेव ह वा न िजजीिवषामस्|
तेऽवि थताः पमुखे धातरा ाः
We do not even know which party is heavier; nor whether we shall win or they will be victorious
and conquer us. These very sons of Dhritarashtra killing whom we do not wish to live, are standing
here. (6)
(52) O God, I have freely and thoughtfully spoken out what was in my mind but if there is something
else which is right, you are the better judge.
(53) Those in whose case, we should better kill ourselves than to listen to the words that we have
enmity with them, are standing here for the purpose of fighting.
(54) So, we do not know what is more creditable, whether we should kill these or go away avoiding
them.
काप यदोषोपहत वभावः|
पृ छािम वां धमसंमूढचेताः
य छेयः याि नि तं बूिह त मे|
िश य तेऽहं शािध मां वां पप नम्
With my very nature defeated by the vice of cowardice and my mind being confused as regards
my duty, I am asking you. Tell me, “what is definitely creditable; I am your disciple and I have put
myself into your hands. Please, I pray you to instruct me. (7)
