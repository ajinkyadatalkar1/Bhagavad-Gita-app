(872) So, by perceiving it, the language that it is or it is not, becomes mute and the way of thought is
closed.
(873) Just as the element of earth is existing in all the articles like a jar, a pot or a pitcher, taking
their particular shape and appearance, that supreme knowable is permeated in everything by
becoming everything.
सवतः पािणपादं त सवतोऽि िशरोमुखम्|
सवतः शुितम लोक
े सवमावृ य ित ित
It is having hands, feet, eyes, heads, faces and ears everywhere and is existing by covering
everything. (13)
(874) The action which takes place naturally irrespective of the limits of time and space and is born
of the crude as well as the subtle elements and Beings, is truly by the hands of that Absolute
Brahman.
(875) Therefore, that Brahman is called 'the Being with universal arms' because this very Brahman
does all the actions by assuming all the forms.
(876) And O Dhananjaya, it is called 'the Being with universal feet' because it is existing at all
places at one and the same time.
(877) Just as the Sun has no separate body and separate eyes, and the whole Sun is light, similarly
this Being sees all, itself being all at the same time.
(878) Therefore, Vedas have described it as 'the Being with universal eye', though it has no separate
organs like our physical eyes.
(879) It is on the top of everything and all things, and therefore, it is called 'a Being with universal
heads.'
(880) Just see how the very form of fire is itself its mouth; similarly this Brahman being all,
experiences all.
(881) Therefore, O Partha, the term 'Being of universal mouth' has come to be used traditionally by
the Vedas.
(882) And just as the sky is permeating each and every thing, it has ears in every word.
(883) Therefore, we describe it as 'One which has ears everywhere' and thus it is covering every
thing.
