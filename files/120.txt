Even by the ancient aspirants for liberation, action was performed with this thorough
understanding. So, you should perform action as the ancients have done in the ancient times. (15)
(82) Those of the ancient days who were aspirants for liberation, knew me to be free like this, and
performed all actions, O, the wielder of bow!
(83) But those actions were like burnt seeds, which do not sprout though sown, and being such
actions, they themselves became the cause of their liberation.
(84) And Arjuna, there is one more point to be considered here. A man of wisdom should not bother
about what is action and what is inaction.

त े कम पव यािम य ा वा मो यसेऽशुभात्
Even men of intelligence are puzzled over this question of what is action and what is in-action.
Therefore, I shall expound to you the nature of that action, by knowing which you will be free from its
evil effect. (16)
(85) Even the seers are confused to decipher what is called action and what is the sign of inaction.
(86) It is like being confused by a bad coin which looks like a good coin, even when eyes see it
clearly.
(87) So, even in the case of those who can by their power of imagination create new worlds. there is
confusion in their concept of inaction and that inaction has become action.
(88) Why talk about a simple foolish person? Even men of clairvoyance are puzzled about this;
therefore I shall tell you that. Please listen.
कमणो िप बो यं बो यं च िवकमणः|
अकमण बो यं गहना कमणो गितः
The truth about action should be understood and the truth about inaction also should be
understood. Even the truth about prohibited action should also be known. The ways of action are very
unscrutable. (17)
(89) Thus, we have to understand that, action properly, by which this universe is created.
