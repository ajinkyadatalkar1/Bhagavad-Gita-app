(67) Or, when the string of life is nearly ended, ordinary medicine is not effective at that time but the
most potent nectar is only useful.
(68) Similarly my mind does not feel happy even by the gaining of kingdom, the pleasures and the
prosperity. What is needed is only your compassion for us, O! The reservoir of kindness!
(69) Arjuna said like this and then for a moment, his confusion left him, but alas! He was again
caught in another wave of depression.
(70) Or, if I consider his condition rightly, this was not merely a wave, but he was virtually grasped
by the venomous serpent called the great confusion!
(71) And as his soft sentimental mind was fully overflowing with compassion, the pangs of this nasty
bite were not at all subsiding.
(72) Seeing this pitiable condition of Arjuna, the Lord Shrikrishna who is a famous magician who
can free a man from poison merely by looking at him, sympathetically turned towards him.
(73) So, the Lord Shrikrishna was near Arjuna in such a helpful mood, and he will now protect
Arjuna by his compassion.
(74) Therefore, seeing this whole scene, I have described Arjuna as “virtually caught by the
venomous serpent called ‘the great confusion.”
(75) So, please see how Arjuna was, at that time, enwrapped by illusion just like the Sun covered by
the screen of clouds.
(76) In this way the great Archer was greatly afflicted with grief, just like a mountain which is on
fire in summer season.
(77) Therefore, Lord Krishna, the dark cloud full of the nectar of kindness, turned benevolently
towards him.
(78) There, his dazzling teeth were equal to the brilliant lightning and his deep resonant voice was
equal to the thunder.
(79) Now, how the benevolent cloud that is Lord Krishna, will pour blessings by which the mountain
that is Arjuna will become cool, and how there will be new sprout of fresh inspiration -
(80) Is the story to which you please listen with joyous mind, says Dnyandeva, the servant of Guru
Nivrutti.
