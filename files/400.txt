(208) Treating blame and praise with the quiet forbearance, as only one thing and not two different
things, he conducts his life with the same equipoise either in society or in a forest.
(209) He does not talk, either the truth or the lie, and does not fail to experience the state of Brahman
continuously, without deviation.
(210) He who is not elated by gain nor depressed by loss, just as the sea which does not dry up even
