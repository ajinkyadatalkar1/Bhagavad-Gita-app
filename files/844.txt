thread ceremony. He was named WAMAN. He went to the pandal where
the hundredth sacrifice was in progress, and as a beggar requested to
give him only the land that can be covered in three steps. Shukra, the
priest and Guru of that demonic lineage advised Bali not to give the
demanded Land as Waman was Lord Vishnu who could cover all the
three worlds in three steps. Bali however, did not pay attention. Shukra
entered the pot of water, a zari, through the nozzle of which, water was
to be dribbled on the palm of Waman as an indication of having given
away the requisite charity. Bali thought that in the nozzle there was
some obstruction, so he put a sharp grass blade in it. Shukra was sitting
there in a very tiny form. The grass blade poked in the eye and he
became blind by that eye. He came out. The water was poured on the
palm of Waman, who immediately assumed the great form of the Lord of
Universe and occupied two worlds by two steps and put the third step
on the head of Bali. Bali accepted to go to Patala, but he requested for a
favour from Vishnu, saying that Vishnu should guard his main door in
his Patala palace. Vishnu accepted this. This is referred to in this verse.

These two verses refer to the episode in the childhood of Krishna. At
the age of about one and half year, Krishna ate some dust, a common
habit in children - which his mother Yashoda saw and admonished him,
asking him to open his mouth and show what he had eaten. The divine
child showed her his open mouth; with all the guilty conscience quite
evident on his face; but what Yashoda saw was so grand and stupendous
that she fainted! She saw all the fourteen worlds within his opened
mouth. These two verses are showing us the real Divinity of Krishna,
which was not easily known to ignorant persons.
