(137) But O, the husband of Subhadra, you should know that in the sacrifice which is manifest as
Karma (Action), the Brahman as Vedas is always established.
एवं पविततं चक
ं नानुवतयतीह यः|
अघायु रि दयारामो मोघं पाथ स जीवित
O Arjuna, he who does not follow the wheel thus set going in this world lives as a sinful and
sensual person, whose life is a waste. (16)
(138) I have thus told you in short. O, the Great Archer, the ancient tradition (in the sequences of
creation and offering in the performance of duty) of sacrifice.
(139) So, he who arrogantly does not follow this sacrifice, which is thoroughly appropriate in this

the only thing to be performed with all the devotion.

He however, who is interested in the joy in the self and is contented in his self, satisfied in

(146) Just see! Only he, who is blissfully joyous in his own being, does not become sullied by the
affairs of his body though his body has its functions.
(147) Please understand. Since he gets all the satisfaction and happiness in his own blissful Atman,
