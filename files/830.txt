battle and defeated him. Being subdued, that Gandharva made
friendship with Pandavas and gave Arjuna a special occult power to see
very minute articles.
(7) Chapter 2, Ovi-38.
Arjuna says - Am I Bhasmasura? Bhasmasura was a demon who was
born in the ashes which the Lord Shankar used to apply to his body. By
worshipping the Lord, this demon obtained a boon that if he would put
his hand on the head of any person, that person would be turned into
ashes, so that there would not be shortage of ashes from burning of a
dead body for the Lord - The demon misused this power and once tried
to put his hand on the head of the Lord Shankara himself. The Lord ran
to the God Vishnu, who took the form of a beautiful damsel by name
Mohini, and under the pretext of dancing before a deity with
Bhasmasura as her bridegroom, made him dance, in which he was to
follow the steps of dance as she was dancing. Mohini suddenly took a
posture in the dance, with both of her hands above her head. Bhamasura
did likewise and by the force of his boon he himself was turned into
ashes and thus great danger to all was averted. So, Bhasmasura is
likened to a man who goes against his own benefactor.

Reference to the King Janaka.
The king of Mithila city state, Janaka conducted his rule of the
kingdom perfectly and discharged all his royal duties extremely well,
but as he had perfect self-knowledge he was not attached or involved
mentally in any action, and maintained his state of freedom.
