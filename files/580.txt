happiness and one can get it only by divine blessing or good luck.
शीभगवानुवाच-
अभयं स वसंशुि ानयोग यवि थितः|
दानं दम य वा याय तप आजवम्
The Lord said- Fearlessness, Purity of consciousness, fixed attention to the yoga of meditation for
reaching self-knowledge, charity with piety, control of the senses, sacrifice, self-study, penance,
simplicity of the guileless mind and cleanliness of body also. (1)
(68) Fearlessness is the most prominent and leading virtue of all the divine virtues.
(69) Just as he who does not jump into a flood, has no fear of being drowned, or just as no disease
can attack a person who follows strict regimen;
(70) Similarly, the quality by which a man drops all fear of worldly involvement by not allowing
pride to raise its head in the performance of right action or not doing wrong actions.
(71) Or, the quality by which a man banishes the feeling of fear because his sense of total unity with
the world has become fully effective;
(72) The fear totally disappears, just as salt when water tries to sink it, becomes itself one with the
water,- because he dwells in complete non-duality.
(73) This should be known as the virtue of fearlessness, which is the function of right knowledge.
(74) Now the purity of consciousness should be known by the signs as follow. The ash does not burn
nor does it get extinguished.
(75) Like the Moon who is not affected by the increasing phases from the first day of the lunar month
or not decreased by the last night of the lunar month, but she is actually constant in her own
existence;
(76) Like the Ganges which does not overflow in the rainy season nor becomes dry in the summer,
but has a continuous medium flow.
(77) When the intellect drops the two qualities of Rajas and Tamas, which are like
a pair of scales causing imbalance and when it is completely fixed in the performance of the
ordained duties only with faith and love;
(78) When the mind neither becomes elated nor depression affects it, either by pleasurable or
uncomfortable sensations brought to it by the sense-organs;
