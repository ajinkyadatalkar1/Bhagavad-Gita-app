(802) Because in this process of such indulgence the sense-organs are
pampered, the religions activities are thwarted and there are festivities
of enjoyments of pleasures.
(803) Sins become stronger, and they lead the Jeeva to degraded
conditions, like hell, so in short, enjoyment of pleasures in such
manner becomes harmful in the other world.
(804) In the Prakrut language poison is called "Mahur" which means
sweet, but it proves to be poison by killing in the end; similarly the
joy which is first sweet but in the end it is bitter;
(805) O Parth, that pleasure is to be known as of Rajas quality. You
should not touch it any time.
यदगे चानुब धे च सुखं मोहनमा मनः|
िनदाऽल य-पमादो थं त ामसमुदा तम्
That which stupefies the self at the beginning as well as at its result, which is derived from sleep,
indolence and wrong action, is called Tamasic pleasure. (39)
(806) Now that pleasure which is experienced by man by drinking prohibited drinks, eating
prohibited food and by having promiscuity with harlots.
(807) Or that pleasure which is derived by killing others, stealing other's possessions and that which
a man feels by listening to his flattery done by soothsayers;
(808) That pleasure which is experienced through lassitude, or seen in the sleep in dream-state and
by which a man forgets his duty at the beginning as well as in the end.
(809) O Partha, know that such pleasure is Tamasic in all respects. I am not going to dwell on this
description further, because it is not appropriate to be articulated, and is totally blame-worthy.
(810) Thus there are three types of the results of threefold actions, which are really one only
originally, which I have made clear to you.
(811) Now you should understand that there is nothing in the world which is not classified in three
ways as regards the actor, the action and the result of the action.
