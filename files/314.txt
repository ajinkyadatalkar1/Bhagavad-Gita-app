of Samas in the Vedas."
(282) You should know without doubt that the Chhanda which is called Gayatri is my other form,
among all he Chhandas (Vedic Meters).
(283) The wielder of Sharnga bow (Shrikrishna) said, "I am Margasheersha among the months and
the Spring which is the store- house of flowers, among the seasons."
ूतं छलयतामि म तेज तेजि वनामहम्|
जयोऽि म यवसायोऽि म स वं स ववतामहम्
वृ णीनां वासुदेवोऽि म पा डवानां धन जयः|
मुनीनाम यहं यासः कवीनामुशना किवः
I am gambling among deceitful practices, and the glory of the glorious. I am the victory of the
victorious, the resolve of the resolute, and the goodness of the good. (36)
I am Krishna among the Vrishni's, Arjuna (Dhananjaya) among the sons of Pandu, Vyasa among
the sages, and the sage Ushana among the seers. (37)
(284) O the clever one, I am the gamble of the gamblers, the art of deceiving others at stake. That is
why though there is robbery openly committed nobody can prevent it.
(285) My dear, I am the brightness of all the bright things. I am the victory or success in all the
purposeful undertakings.
(286) The King of the gods (Shrikrishna) said, "I am that business in which there is justice faithfully
followed."
(287,288) Ananta said- "Among all the strong and austere, I am the austerity. Among the Yadavas I
am that glorious boy, who was born of the parents, Vasudeva and Devaki and which was taken to
Gokula in exchange of eternal Virgin, and who squeezed Putana together with her life by drinking
her milk.
(289) Without letting the bud of my childhood to blossom, I made the world devoid of demons, and
by lifting the mountain, I destroyed the pride of Mahendra.
(290) I am that boy who removed the poisonous thorn in the heart of river Yamuna (Kaliya, the great
cobra), protected the Gokula from great fire, and confused the god Brahma by creating duplicate
cows and calves.
(291) In the dawn of childhood, I playfully destroyed the big demons like Kansa.
