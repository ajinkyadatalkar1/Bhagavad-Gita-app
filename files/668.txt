(218) When the speech is addressed to one man but it also becomes helpful to all others like water
given to the roots of one tree, gives life to the grass around it;
(219) If Ganges is of nectar, it certainly makes one deathless, but also makes us cool and pure by
removing the heat and blemishes, by our bathing in it.
(220) Similarly the speech which discards bad indiscriminate thinking, our real beginningless,
eternal nature is revealed and one never gets bored while listening to it because it is sweet as
nectar.
(221) If at all someone asks something, then there is talk, otherwise one may continue with one's
study of Veda-recitation;
(222) Such a man, actually establishes all the three Vedas in the home of his speech and has as if

(223) Or he continuously chants some name of God, either of the Lord Vishnu or that of the Lord
Shiva- such is the nature of penance of speech.
(224) After this the great leader of the Lords of all worlds, the Lord Shrikrishna, said "Now listen to

serpents have left the garden of the sandalwood trees,
(226) Or, the changes in the shapes of the Moon which are her phases have left the Moon; or anxiety
has left a king, or the Mandar mountain has left the sea (and the sea is calm),
(227) When similar to these, the mind is left by various networks of complicated doubts and is thus
free and pure in its real aloneness,
(228) Or light is without the troublesome heat, or juice is without its heaviness, or the sky is without
its emptines;
(229) Similarly he who achieves his own welfare and sees his own Self which is blissful and as the
limbs already frozen do not feel the cold of ice afterwards, he forgets his own normal self;
