In Madhuwan, the Lord Vishnu touched the cheek of the young
Dhruva, by his conch to give him power of speech for prayer and praise.
The story is that when the Lord Vishnu appeared before Dhruva, in his
divine form, that boy was so astonished by the glory of the God that he
became as if dumb! Seeing his condition like this, Vishnu touched his
cheek by his conch. That touch made Dhruva able to speak! This Ovi

to have the longest life-span. He once requestd God to let him see the
great power of the Maya of God. God agreed but did not act

was drowned in water but he was alone swimming on the surface of that
water. He then saw on a little leaf of a baniyan tree a small child
sleeping. He went into the body of that child where he saw another
world inside the body of the child just as there was the world with
which Markandeya was familiar earlier. With the outgoing breath of that
child he saw himself again coming out; but this time he saw that he was
