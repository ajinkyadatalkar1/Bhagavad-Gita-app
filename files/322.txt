Arjuna alone become able to defeat the large army of eleven
Akshouhini?
(24) Therefore, how can any work in the whole world become
unsuccessful, when such great persons like you do it? Similarly it is
the saints like you, who should enable me to speak.
(25) Now I am going to talk. Please listen to this meaning of Geeta,
which is spoken personally by the Lord of Vaikuntha.
(26) Geeta is really a great book in which the Lord Shri Krishna, who is
the main deity of worship of Vedas, is Himself the speaker.
(27) How can one praise the greatness of this Geeta, when even the
intellect of the Lord Shambhu cannot understand it? So, it is better to
salute it with heart and soul.
(28) Now please listen, how Arjuna started to talk, keeping in mind his
desire to see the Universal God.
(29) He desired that, what he experienced in principle as the all-
pervasiveness of the Lord, should be visible actually to his eyes.
(30) This desire was hidden in his mind, but to express it before the
God was a bit difficult for him. He thought it awkward to ask because
the universal form of God is the most secret thing.
(31) He said to himself, "How can I ask Shrikrishna to show me that
thing about which nobody has had asked ever,- even an intimate
devotee?
(32) I may be a very intimate friend, but can my intimacy be equal to his
mother? Even she was afraid to ask this.
