(409) Therefore, O Pandava, we should have such equanimity that we should look at the universe
within us and we should become the universe.
(410) We have been telling you this thing again and again because the state of equilibrium is the
highest aim. There is nothing beyond it to be achieved.
अजुन उवाच-
योऽयं योग वया पो ः सा येन मधुसूदन|
एत याहं न प यािम च चल वात् ि थितं ि थराम्
च चलं िह मनः क
ृ ण पमािथ बलवद् ढम्|
त याहं िनगहं म ये वायो रव सुदु करम्
On this, Arjuna said ‘O Krishna, the slayer of Madhu demon, I do not perceive that this yoga can
be steadily practised, which you have just described as a ‘state of equilibrium’, because the mind is
very restless. (33)
O Krishna, the mind is very turbulent, very fickle and very forceful. I think that it is as difficult to
curb it, as controlling the wind. (34)
(411) Then Arjuna said, “You may very well have pity on us and teach all this but it is not suitable
for the fickle nature of the mind.
(412) If we try to find the shape and structure of the mind, we cannot find it anywhere; but, for its
flights, even all the three worlds are not sufficient.
(413) So, how can it be possible that a monkey will go into trance or the speedy wind will stop
blowing by our saying so?
(414) The mind harasses the intellect, shakes up the determination, and deceives the courage in a
slip of moment.
(415) It confuses the discretion, entices into desire the contentment, makes a journey of all directions
if we try to make it sit at a place.
(416) It resurges if we try to suppress it, the effort to control it gives it more strength. How can it
give up its nature which is so fickle?
(417) Therefore, it will not be possible that the mind will remain steady, and then we can achieve
the equilibrium.
