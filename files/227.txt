me in my absolute aspect reaches the supreme goal. (13)
(116) One should still the vital breath in the space in the heart, in such a way that the three syllables
of AUM will be merged into the last half syllable and when the unity will be achieved that
soundless sound of AUM will be established in the absolute Brahman.
(117) Here, the memory of AUM ceases to be, the vital breath is dissolved and only the pure
Brahman remains.
(118) Therefore, AUM is my Brahman aspect in the form of one letter; and one who, while
remembering this aspect, -
(119) Leaves his physical body, attains unity with my pure nature, having attained which there is
nothing further to be attained.
(120) Now, O Arjuna, perhaps your mind will have a doubt as to "how can one be sure that this
memory will be there at the time of death?"
(121) At that time the organs are disorganised, the comfort and steadiness of the life force is gone
and there are signs of death having over-powered the man inside and out.
(122) At such a time, who will take up a posture? Who will control the senses? And whose mind
will meditate on ‘AUM?’ It is all impossible.’’
(123) Perhaps you may harbour such questions in your mind, but it should be noted that if throughout
the life, a man always meditates upon me, I come to help him like a servant at the time of his
death.

O Partha, whosoever always thinks of me with undivided mind, to that yogi who is ever absorbed
in me, I am easily attainable. (14)
Great souls, who have attained the highest perfection, having reached me, are no more subjected
to rebirth which is the abode of sorrow and is transient by nature. (15)
(124) Those who perform the last rites of sense objects and lock-up the outgoing desire, hold me in
their heart and enjoy the Reality,
