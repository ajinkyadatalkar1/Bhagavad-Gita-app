(188) Dear Arjuna, he feels it a calamity in his popularity and does not allow any greatness to touch
him at all.
(189) He cannot bear the sight of his being felicitated and honoured. He does not like his virtues
being sung, and he cannot bear that people are remembering him with gratitude.
(190) Then what to talk about his being given great respect? He does not even like people to salute
him, which appears to him as painful as death.
(191) Even though he is as learned as the Guru of gods, he feigns insanity and runs away from
people, thus remaining hidden.
(192) He covers up his cleverness, abhors greatness, and behaves like an eccentric person
purposefully.
(193) He is bored of good name in the public. He is tired of dry arguments on scriptures and likes to
live quietly in isolation.
(194) He feels it good, if the world insults him, or neglects him and if his relatives do not bother him
in any way.
(195) He purposely behaves in such a way that he appears to be nothing in the eyes of men, and he is
happy to maintain a low profile.
(196) He always wishes that people should not be sure of whether he is living or dead. He desires to
be so much incognito,
(197) He walks so modestly that people may doubt whether he is walking or not, or he is pushed by
breeze.
(198) He wishes that his existence should be wiped out from public memory, his name and form
should be lost and he should be abhored by all beings.
(199) He desires to be like this. He always prefers to live in solitude, and as soon as he hears the
name of any isolated place, he becomes more alive.
(200) He is friendly with the wind; he likes to have a dialogue with sky and he loves very keenly.
(201) So, if you see such signs in any person, then you should know that he is very intimate with
knowledge.
(202) The Absence of pride in a man should be recognised by these signs. Now I will show you how
to recognize the lack of hypocrisy.
