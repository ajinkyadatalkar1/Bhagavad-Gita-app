(419) The one who is born has no other destiny except death. Everyone is going of his own accord
into the jaws of death.
(420) All the things created are, of their own accord, going towards this abysmal mouth and this
universal Being is where He is, without moving anywhere and is gluttonously eating up
everybody.
(421) Brahma and other gods are entering His mouth which is on a higher level and all the ordinary
armymen in this Bharat war are jumping into a mouth which is at a lower level.
(422) Many things and beings are automatically dying as soon as born, and none escapes from this
mouth.

Just as the many streams of water of rivers run towards the sea, so, all these brave men from the
human world are entering into the brightly burning mouths. (28)
(423) The world is running from all sides into this mouth, just like the waters of great rivers rush

speedily running to enter into your mouths. (29)
(425) Just as in the burning valleys of mountains there are innumerable moths falling simultaneously,
these people are falling in these mouths.
(426) And just as water is eaten up by hot iron, so, whatever falls in these mouths is destroyed
without leaving back even its name.
लेिल से गसमानः सम ता लोका समगा वदनै वलि ः|
तेजोिभरापूय जग समगं भास तवोगाः पतपि त िव णो
O Vishnu! You are licking your tongues on all sides, intent upon gulping up all these people with
