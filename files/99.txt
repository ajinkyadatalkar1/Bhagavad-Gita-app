(155) Know that even for those who have accomplished everything and have no further personal
desires, there is some responsibility of duty for the sake of other people.
(156) Just as a man who can see, walks along with a blind man to guide him on the way, so, a wise
man should show the true religion to an ignorant man, by his own example.
(157) And if this is not done, what will the ignorant man understand? How can he come to know this
path?
य दाचरित शे त देवेतरो जनः|
स य पमाणं क
ु ते लोक तदनुवतते
Whatever a great man does, other people do the same thing; whatever standard he sets up, the
people in the society follow it. (21)
(158) Here whatever the elders do, is called religion by others and all common people follow the
same standard.
(159) This is the most natural thing. Therefore action should not be given up. The saints should
perform their duty more earnestly.
न मे पाथाि त कत यं ितषु लोक
े षु िक
ं चन|
नानवा मवा यं वत एव च कमिण
O Arjuna, There is nothing in all the three worlds that is binding upon me, nor is there anything
not obtained which I have to obtain! Even then I continue to work. (22)
(160) Now, O Arjuna of beautiful crown! Why should I talk about others? Look at me! I am also
working in the same manner.
(161) If you say that I may be working with some motive, as if there is anything short to fulfil which I
am active;
(162) Then you know that nobody can stand equal to me in the matter of supreme capacity; such is
the fullness of powers in me.
(163) You have seen the feat which I achieved in bringing back from the dead, the son of Guru
Sandipani. Even then I am continuously performing my duties.
यिद हं न वतयं जातु कम यतंिदतः|
