तत ततो िनय यैतदा म येव वशं नयेत्
He should, through gradual practice attain peace, by intellect made firm with courage; and turning
the mind inwards into Atman, he should not think of anything else. (25)
Drawing back the restless and fidgety mind from all and every gate of sense-organs through which
it runs outside, he should again and again control it and subdue it to be obediment to Atman only. (26)
(378) If the intellect gets the support of courage, it will guide the mind gradually towards the temple
of Atman.
(379) You should know that by this way also the final realization is possible, but if you cannot do
this, please listen to another method.
(380) We should take such a vow that the mind will not take even a step outside the determined path.
(381) If the mind becomes steady by this firm will, it may be considered that the task is done, but if
the mind does not remain still by this method, then we should slacken all control and let it loose.
(382) Then from whatever object the mind has gone to, we should control it and bring it back to
itself, so that it will learn the practice of its own control.
पशा तमनसं ेनं योिगनं सुखमु मम्|
उपैित शा तरजसं ब भूतमक मषम्
To the yogi whose mind is perfectly calm, who is without any sin, whose passion is quietened,
and who is one with the Absolute Brahman, the highest happiness comes of its own accord. (27)
(383) Then being habitually steady, the mind will easily come nearer to the state of unity with
Atman.
(384) Looking at Atman, it will immediately get involved into it and the duality will be merged into
unity. The three worlds will shine brilliantly with the light of that unity.
(385) Clouds are seen separate from the sky but when they disappear, the sky is only one
everywhere, filling all the universe.
(386) Similarly the mind is dissolved. Everything is pure energy, (Chaitanya). This is the final
attainment of this yoga which is easy.
