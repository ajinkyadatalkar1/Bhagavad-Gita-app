(229) If you are of such an attitude of mind, naturally there will be no sin. Therefore, now you should
fight without any doubts.
एषा तेऽिभिहता सां ये बुि य गे ि वमां शृणु|
बु या यु ो यया पाथ कमब धं पहा यिस
O Arjuna, this attitude of mind is told to you which is according to Sankhya system of philosophy.
Now listen to it as presented in the yoga of selfless action. Equipped with this concept intelligently, O
Partha, you will throw away the bondage of Karma. (39)
(230) I have told you this attitude according to Sankhyas (path of knowledge) in short. Now please
listen to the yoga of intelligence coupled with action.
(231) O Partha, if one adopts this yoga, then the bondage of karma will not affect one at all.
नेहािभकमनाशोऽि त प यवायो न िव ते|
व पम य य धम य तायते महतो भयात्
In this path of unattached, unselfish action there is no loss of well-directed performance of duty
nor are there retrograde effects. Even a little measure of this discipline saves us from the great danger
of the cycle of birth and death. (40)
(232) When we wear a steel armour, we may bear the beatings of all weapons, and still our victory
is certain, without any disturbance.
(233) In this way the worldly benefit is not lost and final liberation is also insured. The sequence of
Sankhya philosophy is also followed.
(234) We have to go along with the system of self-less action but not look out for any resultant
benefit. This is just like an exorcist not being affected by the ghost.
(235) When this intelligent attitude towards action is perfectly understood, we are not affected by
any concommitant effects.
(236) This yoga of action is very subtle but unaffected by the three qualities of Sattwa, Rajas and
Tamas and, therefore, it is very firm.
(237) O Arjuna, even if the light of this is slightly but properly lit in our heart, the fear of worldly
life is totally obviated.
