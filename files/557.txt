यदािद यगतं तेजो जग ासयतेऽिखलम्|
य च दमिस य चा नौ त ेजो िवि मामकम्
The light in the Sun that gives illumination to the whole world, and that which shines in the Moon
and the fire, know that light to be mine only. (12)
(398) It should be known that the light which illuminates the Sun and the whole structure of this
universe, is my own light from the beginning to the end.
(399) O the son of Pandu! It is my soft light in the Moon which provides life-giving nectar to the
world when the Sun sets.
(400) And it is my enhanced heat which cooks the food, or burns, which is in the fire.
गामािव य च भूतािन धारया यहमोजसा|
पु णािम चौषधीः सवाः सोमो भू वा रसा मकः
And entering the earth, I support all creatures by my vital power and becoming the moon full of
nectar, I nourish all plants. (13)
(401) I have entered into the earth and, therefore, though the earth is full of dust, the great waters
cannot dissolve it.
(402) And I myself enter the Earth and give the earth the strength by which it sustains the burden of
all creatures.
(403) O son of Pandu, by being the Moon I have become the moving lake of nectar.
(404) I make its rays into the streams of nectar and nourish plants on the Earth.
(405) Thus I produce grains etc. in plenty and feed all the creatures so that they live.
(406) But though the grains are available who gives the heat necessary to cook food?
अहं वै ानरो भू वा पािणनां देहमािशतः|
पाणापानसमायु ः पचा य नं चतुिवधम्
Taking the form of the fire in the bodies of all creatures, and united with vital breath and the
Apana of breath, I digest the four kinds of food. (14)
(407) For this, I become the oven on the navel of beings and the heat in their stomach.
