(102) He goes everywhere though sits at one place; or for that matter, he becomes the universe even
though he is in one body.
य य सव समार भाः कामसंक पविजताः|
ानाि नद धकमाणं तमाहः पि डतं बुधाः
He whose undertakings are all without a projection of desire, and whose actions are burnt up by
the fire of wisdom - is called a wise man by those who have knowledge (in this respect). (19)
(103) He who does not feel sorry that he has to do some work, nor is there any hope for fruit, in his
mind;
(104) And whose mind is not contaminated with the desire that “I shall do a certain work, or shall
complete certain work which I have already started”.
(105) You should recognize such man as the Absolute Brahman in the Human form, who has burnt all
actions in the fire of knowledge.
य वा कमफलासंगं िन यतृ ो िनराशयः|
कम यिभपवृ ोऽिप नैव िक
ं िच करोित सः
He who having totally given up attachment to actions and their fruit, no longer depends on
anything and is always contented, does not do any work though fully engaged in action. (20)
(106) He is disinterested in his body, has no hankering for fruit and is always alert and enthusiastic.
(107) He is in the sanctum sanctorium of contentment and when the food of self-knowledge is served
he does not say “enough”, O, the great archer!
िनराशीयतिच ा मा य सवप रगहः|
शारीरं क
े वलं कम क
ु वन् ना नोित िकि बषम्
य छालाभसंतु ो ातीतो िवम सरः|
समः िस ाविस ौ च क
ृ वाऽिप न िनब यते
Having subdued his mind and body, and having given up all possessions, and free from craving,
he, who performs only bodily activities does not incur blemish of sin. (21)
The Karmayogi who is contented with whatever he gets unasked for, is free from jealousy and is
beyond all pairs of opposites, and keeps his mind balanced both in success and failure, is not bound
by his actions. (22)
