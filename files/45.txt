Then the cross breeding of castes ensures the fall in hell, both for the persons who thus destroy
the race, and for the race itself. Deprived of the offerings of food and water in the death-rituals, the
ancestors of that race also suffer degradation in hell. (42)
(252) Then, there is hell for the whole family as well as for those who destroy the tradition and the
family.
(253) And see how, when the whole continuance of the race is thus destroyed, the ancestors who are
in heaven also fall down to hell.
(254) This is because, when both the regular and occasional religious observances get lost, who
would bother to offer sacred water to fore-fathers and to whom would he offer it?
(255) Then, what will be the fate of the ancestors? How can they retain their status in the heaven?
So, those poor fore-fathers also come down to the level of their families.
(256) Just as when a serpent bites a man at the tip of his toe nail, the poison in no time, reaches the
brain. Similarly by the stigma of this sin, the whole ancestral tree becomes defiled right up to the
primordial patriarch.

When by the actions of these killers of kinsmen, these evils which bring about the inter-mixture of
castes become prevalent, the age-long caste-traditions and family customs are also lost. (43)

O Janardana, we hear that the stay of men who have lost their family traditions of religious
conduct is surely for unlimited period in the hell. (44)

O! What a pity that due to the lust for the kingdom and enjoyment, we are intent upon killing our
own kinsmen and thus committing great sin! (45)
