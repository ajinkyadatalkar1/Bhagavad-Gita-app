the weapons of self-control of thoughts and actions. You are the sea
of compassion!
(8) Victory to you, the God of only one form as God alone! You are the
one who overpowers the sullenness of the serpent of carnal desire!
You are the lamp giving light in the homes of faithful devotees. You
are the remover of all types of troubles.
(9) Victory to you, the God without a second! You are extremely liked
by those who have attained complete peace. You are subservient to
your devotees! You are the right deity to be worshipped, but you are
not reachable by the great Maya.
(10) Victory to you, the God who are my Guru! You are the wish tree
who gives that fruit about which no imagination can be ventured.
You are the rich field in which the seed of the tree of self knowledge
is sown and it produces energetic sprouts!
