all my sincerity. Therefore I request you to please listen to this.
(45) The Lord Shrikrishna, the ruler of Dwarka who is like the full
moon who causes the high tide in the sea of the highest joy, said that-
(46) My dear son of Pandu, the illusion of this universe which becomes
an impediment in the way to reach the Reality,
(47) Should not be taken as the panorama of the universe as it appears,
but should be seen as a great tree.
(48) But this tree has no roots down in the earth and branches above
like any other tree and, therefore, generally nobody can grasp what is
its structure and nature.
(49) If a tree is burnt or cut at the root, then even if it has great expanse
of foliage;
(50) It immediately topples down, But this tree of worldly life is not so
easily destroyed.
(51) Dear Arjuna, this is an extra-ordinary thing that this tree has its
growth downwards.
(52) Just as the Sun is at an uncalculated height, and its rays spread
downwards, similarly this tree of worldly life develops and expands
downwards.
(53) Just as the waters at the time of final deluge occupy the whole sky,
similarly this tree of worldly life fills every nook and corner of the
universe.
(54) Or as, when the Sun sets, the night is full of darkness; similarly
the whole sky is totally filled by this tree.
