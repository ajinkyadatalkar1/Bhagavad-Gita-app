Sanjaya said (to Dhritarashtra) -
Madhusudana (Shrikrishna) addressed Arjuna who was thus overwhelmed with pity, and whose
eyes were full of tears, and who was having dejection, in the following words- (1)
(1) Sanjaya said to the king - “Please listen further. On the battlefield, Arjuna was thus overpowered
by sorrow and started sobbing.
(2) Having seen the whole groups of his various family relations, he was affected by deep sense of
pity and, see, how his heart melted by compassion.
(3) Like salt being dissolved into water, or like clouds being blown by wind, his mind, though
otherwise sound, was much disturbed.
(4) He was a victim of pity and seemed to be withered or like a swan caught in mud.
(5) The son of Pandu became helpless due to great confusion and misunderstanding, seeing which
Shrikrishna, the wielder of 'Sharnga' bow, said to him.
शीभगवानुवाच -
क
ु त वा क मलिमदं िवषमे समुपि थतम्|
अनायजु म व यमक ितकरमजुन
Shri Bhagwan said, “How has this shadow of pity overtaken you at this odd hour of battle? O
Arjuna, it is befitting only to the ignoble persons. It will not bring for you either the heavenly
happiness or good fame in this world. (2)
(6) O Arjuna, first see what is proper at this place and consider what you are and what you are
doing.
(7) My Dear, what is wrong with you? What is wanting? Is the job undertaken already spoiled? Why
this sorrow?
(8) You are not a man to give your mind to anything improper, and you do not lose your patience any
time. My Dear, when your name is heard, the very ‘failure’ runs away far beyond horizon.
(9) You are the store-house of bravery. You are the leader among Kshatriyas and the fame of your
adventurous achievements encompass all the three worlds.
(10) You have defeated Lord Shankara in fight, and you have wiped out even the name of ‘Nivata -
Kavacha’ demons and you have compelled the Gandharva angels to praise you.
