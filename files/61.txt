(142) Or, there is space within a room, and it appears to be of the shape of the room, but even if the
room is demolished, the space is as it is.
(143) Similarly even if the body disintegrates, the Reality is not destroyed; therefore, my dear, do
not superimpose the idea of destruction on this Reality.
