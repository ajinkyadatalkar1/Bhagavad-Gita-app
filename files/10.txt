Indrayani, while Vitthalpanta was doing daily worship of the Sun and
worship of the images of Gods. After taking the bath in waters of the
river Indrayani, he was seen by Shri Siddheshwara, commonly called
Siddhopanta, who was the revenue authority of Alandi (Kulkarni).
When Siddhopanta saw this young man, he was much impressed by the
peace and serenity on the shining face of the young worshipper, and
enquired of him about his name and town of origin. Knowing him to be
a worthy gentleman of religious inclinations, Siddhopanta requested
him to visit his home. At home the host Siddhopanta welcomed and
honoured the guest with great respect. Siddhopanta had a daughter
Rukmini, who was of marriageable age. He thought that this guest was
the right bride-groom for her. With proper preliminary talks, the
marriage took place, on one auspicious day.
After marriage, Vithalpanta went for pilgrimage in the Southern India,
to places like Viankadri, Arunachala, Madura, and also Rameshwar.
Then he went to Gokarna, Kolhapur and saw the confluence of the rivers
Krishna and Venya at Karhad. He came back at Alandi and stayed at the
house of Siddhopanta. Thus after finishing his pilgrimage of various
places in India, Vitthalpanta started to go back to Apegaon, his own
home.
Siddhopanta also accompanied Vitthalpanta and Rukmini to
Apegaon. The father of Vithalpanta and his mother, viz. Govindpanta
and Nirabai were very happy to receive their son, daughter-in-law and
the father-in-law of Vitthalpanta. Siddhopanta thus saw the parents of
religious-minded son-in-law, well established in life and went back to
Alandi. After some time the old parents expired, and Vitthalpanta had to
look after his family life, but he was not much interested in earning
money for maintaining family life. Siddhopanta was a bit sorry for this
and out of pity, he took Vithala and Rukmini to his own house in
Alandi. However the apathy of Vithalpanta towards family life persisted
