वजनं िह कथं ह वा सुिखनः याम माधव
Therefore, O Krishna, it is not right for us to kill our relatives, the sons of Dhritarashtra. For, how
can we be happy after killing our relatives, O Madhava? (37)
(233) Therefore I will not commit this act. I will not even hold a weapon in this battle, because I see
this thing is blame-worthy in many ways.
(234) O God! If we will be estranged from you, tell me what will be our plight? Krishna, our hearts
will be broken by separation from you.
(235) Therefore, it is an impossible thing that these Kauravas should be killed and then we should
enjoy the pleasures.
य येते न प यि त लोभोपहतचेतसः|
क
ु ल यक
ृ तं दोषं िमतदोहे च पातकम्
Even if these people whose minds are warped by greed, do not see the evil in the destruction of
their own race and the sin in treachery with friends. (38)
कथं न ेयम मािभः पापाद माि नविततुम्|
क
ु ल यक
ृ तं दोषं पप यि जनादन
How should we not see clearly the sin in this destruction of our family, O Janardana, and know
how to turn away from this sin? (39)
(236) These are puffed-up by their pride and are intent upon war but we have to understand what is
the best for us.
(237) How can we do such a preposterous deed of killing our own kith and kin? Should we take
poison knowingly, with our eyes open?
(238) You see, when a lion is seen crossing our way while we are walking, it is definitely safe for
us to avoid him by getting aside.
(239) O God! What is the benefit of leaving a well-lit area and entering into a dark deep well?
(240) Suppose we see great fire in front of us and if we do not avoid it, it will, in a moment, burn us
down.
(241) Therefore, how should we be willing to commit such a wrong action when these demerits and
blames are imminently going to fall upon us and we know it to be certain?
