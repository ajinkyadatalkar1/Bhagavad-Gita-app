and who is the image of great joy for his mother Devakee. (5)
Because the Lord Shrikrishna was at the helm, Pandavas crossed the
fierce river of the war of Kurukshetra, the river whose two banks were
Bheeshma and Drona, waters were embodied as Jayadratha, in which
there was blue lotus of Shakuni from Gandhara country, the Shark of
Shalya, speedy flow of Kripacharya, the waves of Karna, dangerous
crocodiles of Ashwathama, and Vikarna with the whirlpool of
Duryodhana! (6)
Let the lotus flower that is the epic Mahabharata, which washes the
stigma of Kali-Age, be a source of highest welfare for us! This epic is
having the clean lotus of the purifying language of Vyasa, the son of
sage Parashara. It is very lovely with the fragrance of the meaning of
Geeta, having the pollen of various stories, and is full of the
englightening wisdom contained in the account of the great deeds done
by Lord Hari; and this (divine) lotus is surrounded by saints which are
like the black-bees, who are everyday sipping the nectar from it with
great delight. (7)
I bow before Madhava, the embodiment of Supreme Bliss, whose
grace enables a mute to talk fluently and a lame to climb a high
mountain! (8)
We bow before the God, whose complete nature is not known by all
the gods and the demons, who is praised by all the gods like Brahma,
Varuna, Indra, Marutas, with auspicious hymns, and whose glory is
sung by Sama-singers of Vedas together with various facets like Pada,
Krama (letters and their fixed sequence) and with the Upanishads, and
whom yogis see in their deeply meditative minds totally directed to Him.
