"Some used stones to prepare a pathway across the sea and took a
large army beyond the sea.''
This refers to the famous story of the feat of the monkey-army of
Ramchandra who, by the grace of Ramchandra, constructed by stones
kept floating on the sea, a path (called SETU) on the sea, from India's
Southern shore to Shrilanka's northern shore. The whole army of
monkeys and bears crossed the sea on it; together with Ramchandra and
Laxman.

"Some one caught in his hands the Sun in the sky-''
Hanuman, (the son of Anjani, a female monkey and Kesari a powerful
male monkey) when born at the time of sunrise, became hungry and
suddenly seeing the red ball of the rising Sun, jumped high in heaven
and tried to hold the Sun by his hands to eat him thinking that it was
some kind of fruit.

Sage Agastya drank the whole sea, as if it was handful of water.
When Indra killed the demon Vritra, his followers remained hidden in
the sea and used to come out at night and kill sages and eat them. Being
afraid of them, the sages used to hide in their homes and all rituals etc.
were stopped. Indra sent Agastya to help them. Agastya drank the whole
sea, thus exposing the demons who then died. Later on Agastya let out
the sea-water back. The water was taken by Agastya first, only sipping it
in handfuls. Therefore, the statement referred to above is made.
