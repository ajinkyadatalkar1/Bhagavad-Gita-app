(293) In the case of such a man who is self-satisfied, this desire is totally discarded and he is the
man who is called the man of stable intellect.
दुःखे वनुि नमनाः सुखेषु िवगत पृहः|
वीतरागभयकोधः ि थतधीमुिन यते
The sage whose mind remains unperturbed amidst sorrowful circumstances, whose desire for
pleasures has disappeared and who is beyond attraction, fear and anger, is called man of stable
intellect. (56)
(294) One who is not harassed in various situations full of difficulty and pain, and who is not caught
in the desire for pleasures.
(295) O Arjuna, the desire and anger are naturally not in his character, and he being completely
fulfilled, has no fear.
(296) One who is constantly in this state, should be known as one who has discarded all his
entailments and is without a sense of differentiation.
यः सवतानिभ नेह त पा य शुभाशुभम्|
नािभन दित न ेि त य प ा पिति ता
He who has no special inward attachment and affection for anything and good or evil, whatever
may come before him, he does not rejoice or abhor, is having his intellect steady. (57)
(297) He who is equal to all, just like the full moon, who does not consider anybody lowly or
exulted while giving its light.
(298) He has such undivided equanimity and affection for all beings and has no loss of mood in his
mind at any time.
(299) If he gets some nice thing, he is not overjoyed, and if he gets something defective, he does not
feel dejected.
(300) Such a man who is indifferent to pleasure or sorrow, one who is full of self-knowledge, O the
Great Archer, know him to be a man of steady intellect.
यदा संहरते चायं क
ू म ऽ गानीव सवशः|
इि दयाणीि दयाथ य त य प ा पिति ता
When like a tortoise withdrawing its limbs inside from all directions, he withdraws his senses
from their objects of liking, his intellect is steady. (58)
