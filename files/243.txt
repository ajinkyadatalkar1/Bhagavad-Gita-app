kindness which was asleep has been awakened and, therefore, I am
talking.
(20) In truth, does anybody put the moon-light nicely tucked in grass in
order that it should be ripe? Similarly has anybody tried to tell wind-
‘‘You must blow in this way only,” and to control it? Or is it
possible to cover the whole sky?
(21) Sirs, water does not require anybody to make it liquid. Nobody
puts the churning-rod in butter to churn it. Similarly my poor
commentary finds it impossible to explain the meaning of Geeta and
turns back being ashamed.
(22) Not only this, how can I have the capacity to bring the meaning of
Geeta into Marathi where, making it as a bed to rest upon, even Veda
which is Brahman in the form of words, becoming speechless, goes to
sleep?
(23) Even then my daring to venture into this difficult task is only with
the hope of being very dear to you through my boldness.
(24) Now, therefore, please nourish my aspiration by giving your
attention which is cooler than moonlight and abler than nectar, in the
quality of saving life.
(25) This is because when one glance of benediction is showered upon
me, I immediately get the fullness of my intelligence and
achievement, but if you remain disinterested and the humidity of your
kindness does not bless me, then the sprout of knowledge dries up.
(26) Sirs, listening with attention is the right nourishing diet to the
oratory of a speaker and when it is received, words pregnant with the
meaningful statements about final doctrines are find expression.
