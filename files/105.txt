it takes away the life.
(213) Please see. There is desire in the organs which creates a severe hankering for pleasure, like a
fish which is attracted to a bait.
(214) But in the bait, there is a hook, which kills the fish, which does not know it because it is
hidden.
(215) Similarly if a man follows the desire and hopes to get the objects of pleasure, he will in that
pursuit, become a prey to the fire of anger.
(216) It is just like a hunter who entices and corners a deer into such a situation where he can easily
catch it and kill it.
(217) O Partha, the condition is similar here. Therefore, this contact is not good for you. Know both
the desire and anger as killers.
(218) Therefore, do not at all resort to them. You should not even mentally remember them. Just only
keep up the steady concentration in the self, and do not allow it to be destroyed.
शेया वधम िवगुणः परधमा वनुि तात्|
वधम िनधनं शेयः परधम भयावहः
One’s own duty though devoid of good points or merit, is preferrable to the duty of another well
performed. Even blessed it is to die doing our duty; another’s duty is dangerous for us. (35)
(219) My dear, even if our own duty is hard to perform, it is better to do it, you see!
(220) The duty of others may seem to be very nice, but we should perform our own duty without
mistake.
(221) Please tell me, should a Brahmin take food at the house of a Shoodra, though the food articles
may be tasty and though the Brahmin may be weak?
(222) Why should such a wrong thing be wished for and even if there is such a wish, why should we
actually accept it?
(223) How should we demolish our poor grass hut by looking at the well-built beautiful houses of
others?
(224) Even if our own wife is not so good looking, she is better for us in bed.
(225) Similarly our own duty may be difficult and cumbersome in the matter of actual performance,
still it is really helpful even in the higher world.
