अपरं भवतो ज म परं ज म िवव वतः|
कथमेति जानीयां वमादौ पो वािनित
Arjuna said - Your birth is recent while the birth of Wiwaswan is of the past. How can I believe
that you told this yoga in the past? (4)
(32) At that time Arjuna said, “Shri Hari, O! The reservoir of blessing! There is no reason to
wonder if a mother loves her child.
(33) You are the shelter of those who are fatigued by the tribulations in this life, and you are the
protective mother of the destitutes and it is by your mercy that we are born.
(34) O Lord, if a mother gives birth to a son who is a cripple, she bears all the troubles for him
throughout life. Why should we talk about this in front of you, when the same is your own nature?
(35) Please pay attention to what I am going to ask and the Lord may kindly not get angry by my talk.
(36) O, Ananta, I do not quite agree with what you said about your having taught this yoga in the long
past.
(37) Even my ancesters do not know who this Wiwaswan was! Then how is it that you gave him the
teaching?
(38) He, as we hear, belonged to very ancient times, and you, O Shrikrishna, are of the present times;
and therefore there is some contradiction in your statement.
(39) And O Lord, since we cannot say that we do not know how strange your life is, we cannot all of
a sudden dare say that your statement is false.
(40) So, please tell me the same thing again, that you yourself gave the teaching to the Sun-God, but
let it be in such a simple way that I will understand it.
शीभगवानुवाच-
बहिन मे यतीतािन ज मािन तव चाजुन|
ता यहं वेद सवािण न वं वे थ परंतप
Shri Bhagwan said - “Arjuna, you and I have passed through many births, I remember them all;
but, O! Hexatious to your enemies! You do not remember them.(5)
(41) Upon this, Shrikrishna said to the son of Pandu, “You are under impression that we were not
there when Wiwaswan was living.
