(1074) That state which is the bank on the farther side of 'form', that which is the extreme periphery
of 'sound', which is the central living room of the fourth or Turya state and which is called the
absolute Brahman.
(1075) And that state where all the upward paths rest at the end, together with the Liberation, just as
