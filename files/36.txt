(166) The warriors who were archers started tremendous war with their arrows which resembled
the uncontrollable clouds pouring down at the time of final destruction.
(167) Seeing this however, Arjuna was eager and glad; and with some interest glanced at the army.
(168) He saw all the Kauravas ready to fight and so, the son of Pandu also lifted his bow slowly.

"O Lord of the earth!,’’ He addressed then, the following words to Shrikrishna - “Achyuta, please
place my chariot between the two armies. (21)
यावदेताि नरी ेऽहं यो ुकामानवि थतान्|

यो यमानानवे ेऽहं य एतेऽत समागताः|
धातरा य दुबु ेयु े िपयिचक षवः
