further reporting will be subdued with respect.
(10) The sixth chapter of the book of Geeta is dealing with the
conclusive statement of final principle; Just as by the churning of the
ocean of milk, the finest thing which came out was nectar.
(11) So, the essence of the philosophy of Geeta, the other shore of the
ocean of discrimination or the open treasure of the great wealth of
yoga,
(12) and the place where the root Maya keeps quiet, where the language
of Vedas stops short, and from where a new offshoot sprouts on the
branch of the creeper of Geeta,
(13) Is this sixth chapter. Over and above, I am going to describe this
with the polished language of literary excellence. Please listen to it
with full atten-tion.
(14) No doubt, I am using only Marathi words. But I will select such
extraordinarily juicy ones, and use them in such a way that they will
win the bet of sweetness compared to nectar.
(15) When compared to the delicacy of these words the tenderness of
the tunes in music will also fall short and by their lilting meters,
fragrance will also not upto the mark.
(16) The great sweetness of these words is such that the ears will have
tongues and there will be quarrel amongst all the sense organs.
(17) Normally, word is a sound, a subject of the organ of hearing but
the tongue says that the sweetness of that word is mine and the smell
is the object of the nose but these Marathi words will, by their sweet
smell become the object of nose also.
