(64) The Rajas destroys the strength of Sattwa, and the same faith, when Rajas reaches its unlimited
height, becomes the sweeper, who goes on sweeping Karma.
(65) Then if the fire of Tamas is flared-up, the same faith reaches such a low state that it runs after
any objects.
स वान पा सव य श ा भवित भारत|
श ामयोऽयं पु षो यो य छ ः स एव सः
O the son of the Bharat lineage! The faith of all people is according to their essential quality. This
Purusha or man is the embodiment of faith only. He is as his faith is. (3)
(66) O the wise one! Know that there is no faith anywhere in the whole world of Beings, which is
devoid of these qualities.
(67) Therefore again, though faith is only one natural thing, it is divided according to the three
qualities of Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas.
(68) For example, water is one single element, but as poison it kills, in pepper it is pungent, and in
sugarcane, it is sweet.
(69) Similarly the faith of the man, who is completely Tamasic, and takes birth and dies again and
again in the same quality, is also Tamasic.
(70) Then just as the eye-black (collyrium) and soot (lamp-black) are not different, that faith is itself
Tamas, and not different.
(71) Similarly in the case of a soul, who is Rajasic, his faith is also Rajasic and in the man of
Sattwa, it is Sattwic.
(72) Thus the whole panorama of the universe is cast out of the three types of faith only.
(73) But you should understand the three kinds of stamps which the faith bears according to the three
qualities.
(74) For example, a tree is identified by its flowers, a man's mind is understood by the way he talks,
and the past Karma of a man is known by his present conditions.
(75) Similarly I shall tell you the signs by which the three kinds of faith can be recognised. Please
listen.
