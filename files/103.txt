than this fight.
ये मे मतिमदं िन यमनुित ि त मानवाः|
श ाव तोऽनसूय तो मु य ते तेऽिप कमिभः
Those who with uncoveting and devout mind follow this teaching of mine at all times, are also
released from the bondage of all actions. (31)
(192) O the Great Archer, those who respectfully accept this clear opinion of mine and faithfully
bring it into practice;
(193) should be known to be free of all actions though they are ‘functioning’ in all activities; and
therefore this way of action is definitely the right way to follow.
ये वद यसूय तो नानुित ि त मे मतम्|
सव ानिवमूढां ताि वि न ानचेतसः
Those who, however being jealous of me, do not follow this opinion actively, know those fools
to be deluded in the matter of all knowledge and totally destroyed. (32)
(194) However those who become influenced by the Prakriti, and disregarding this my teaching,
drop it, by becoming fond of their sense-organs,
(195) Those who consider it as common-place, look at it with despise, or say babblingly that this is
only a worthless empty argument,
(196) Know them definitely to be drunk with the wine of enticements, saturated by the poison of
objects of senses, and drowned in the mud of ignorance.
(197) Please see, how a gem put in the hand of a dead body becomes wasted, and how the
congenitally blind man cannot experience the advent of dawn.
(198) Or, as the crow has no use of the rising of the Moon; similarly the stupid persons will not like
this selective thought.
(199) Therefore, Such people who are against this spiritual wisdom, should not be even talked to.
(200) They do not respect the tenching and start blaming it! Tell me, can the moths tolerate bright
light of a lamp?
(201) So, O Partha, just as embracing the flame is sure death to a moth, so indulgence in sense-
objects amounts to suicide.
