cavity is closed and does not take the smell.
(56) Or is the breathing stopped, or the mind has no thoughts or the feeling of hunger or thirst is
stopped.
(57) Whether the waking and dreaming are stopped, or the feet have forgotten to walk, - or leave
these things aside- are birth and death gone?
(58) If nothing of these is stopped, then what is it that is dropped? Therefore, for those who are
within the field of Maya or nature, there is no renouncing of action.
(59) Action is created being dependant on the nature itself; to hold or to renounce it is an unwanted
burden taken by the mind.
(60) Please see - If we climb on a chariot, we keep moving with the chariot even though we sit still.
(61) When there is fast wind, the dry leaf is blown away without its volition, in the sky, being
dependant on the wind.
(62) Similarly by the force of Prakriti (Nature) and by the movement of organs of activity, man who
is not doing any action willfully himself, does various functions.
(63) Therefore, there is no renunciation of action so long as there is contact with nature. In the case
of those, who still say that they will renounce, only their adamant attitude remains!
कमि दयािण संय य य आ ते मनसा मरन्|
इि दयाथान् िवमूढा मा िम याचारः स उ यते
He who outwardly restraining the active organs, still keeps on remembering them in his mind, is a
man of deluded intellect and is called a hypocrite. (6)
(64) Those who discard their proper action, and try to reach the actionfree state, only by restraining
their outer organs of activity -
(65) - are not able to really renounce action, because action is still going on in their mind. They only
show outwardly that they are free from action, which is their poverty.
(66) O Partha, these persons should be recognized as totally attached to the sense-objects, without
any doubt.
(67) Now, I will tell you the sign of the real state of having no expectations of any kind; please
listen.
