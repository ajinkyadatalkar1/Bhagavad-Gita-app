Suppose I do not perform the actions with all my alertness, what will be the effect? People will
follow my example in all respects. (23)
(164) But, with the sole purpose of peoples' welfare, I perform my duty just like a selfish person
would have performed.
(165) I act so that all the beings who are totally dependent on me should not go astray.
उ सीदेयु रमे लोका न क
ु या कम चेदहम्|
संकर य च कता यामुपह यािममाः पजाः
If I cease to act, these worlds will be devasted; not only that, but I will be deemed to be
responsible for the disorder and will indirectly destroy all these people. (24)
(166) If we become lazy and self-centered because we have fulfilled all our desires and there is
nothing for us to do, how can these people be emanci-pated?
(167) The present order of things is such that they look up to us for standards of behaviour, and
follow suit; which system of the society will then be totally destroyed.
(168) Therefore, in this world, one who is really all-powerful and who gives completeness even to
omniscience, should not especially give up his appropriate duty.
स ाः कम यिव ांसो यथा क

O Bharata, as the unwise people act, having attachment, so should the wise man, who aims at
maintenance of the world in good order, act, but without having any attachment. (25)
(169) Please see! Just as a man prompted by his desires works with interest, so should there be that
same enthusiasm when a man having no motive acts.
(170) O Partha, this is so, because this order in the society must be maintained and protected in all
circumstances.
(171) One should perform action according to the dictates of the scriptures and this world should be
directed in proper direction, never thinking or acting as somebody extra-ordinary or separate
from all the common people.
