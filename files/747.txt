fold by the three qualities.
(769) But how clear and pure will be my words? While listening to anything the defects or the
preformed opinions of a man which affect the hearing quality generally pollute the meaning of
these words.
(770) But if the soul within is listening in its pristine purity, the normal way of hearing with
prejudice, becomes deaf; so you should listen to this by your innermost soul.
(771) In this way the Lord set about describing the three types of pleasure or happiness, as follows-
(Saint Dnyaneshwar says-) which I am going to put before you clearly.
सुखं ि वदान ितिवधं शुणु मे भरतवषभ|
अ यासादमते यत दुःखा तं च िनग छित
Now hear from me the threefold happiness too; O the great Leader of Bharatas. that happiness
which a man enjoys by continuous practice and by which his sorrows come to an end; (36)
(772) The Lord said- "Now listen to the description of the signs of three types of happiness which I
have promised."
(773) I shall tell you about the joy which a Jeeva feels when he meets the Atman in such a way that
you can visualize it.
(774) But just as we have to take even the most effective medicine in measured quantities only; or
just as silvery polish can be given to tin gradually only.
(775) Or, we have to sprinkle water twice or thrice on salt to make its solution.
(776) Similarly this joy becomes actual when constant efforts are made after initial experience of
some joy and then the sorrow which is the lot in the life of Jeeva subsides.
(777) That should be known as the joy in the state of Atman, which has three types, which you please
listen as I will go on describing.
य दगे िवषिमव प रणामेऽमृतोपमम्|
त सुखं साि वक
ं पो मा मबुि पसादजम्
Which first appears as if it is poisonous, but tastes like nectar, proves to be so good as nectar in
the end; and it is the product of intellect and Atman being happily together. That joy is declared by
wise people as Sattwic. (37)
