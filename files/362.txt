(487) He completely bowed down folding his body and his hands and started to put his forehead on
the ground near the feet of that God.
(488) He started to talk something, but his throat choked. You can only decide whether it was out of
fear or joy.
(489) But this was the condition of Arjuna by hearing the talk of Shrikrishna. Thus I learnt by the
words in the verse. (Shloka).
(490) He then with the same fear in his mind bowing before the god's feet said, "My Lord, you said
that."

Arjuna said, "O Hrishikesha, it is right that by your fame, the world is jubiliant and entertained,
the demons being afraid run away into all directions, and the great Sanghas of Adepts bow down to
you. (36)
(491) "O Arjuna, I am death and to swallow the world is my game"- This statement of yours, we do
accept as truth.
(492) But it does not look proper to my thought that you are destroying when this is the time for
maintenance of the world.
(493) How can we take out the youth in our body and adopt old age at a wrong time? Therefore
perhaps it may not happen what you say.
(494) Unless four Prahara-times are over, does the sun set at midday?
(495) There are three 'Periods' to you, who are continuous Time as one unit, but these periods are
meant to represent your respective activities according to each period.
(496) When the work of creation starts, the states of existence and destruction are not there and when
the state of existence is maintained the work of creation and destruction is not evident.
(497) Afterwards at the time of Final Dissolution, the work of creation and maintenance is not
evident. This cycle is beginningless and is not changeable.
(498) Therefore, it is not felt right that you are destroying everything, when this is the time for the
world to enjoy the prime time of its existence.
