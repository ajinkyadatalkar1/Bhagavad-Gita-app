The Yoga of the Division of the three Qualities
(1) Victory to the Great Teacher! To the greatest of all Gods! To the
Sun of the Light of Intuition! To the Advent of Happiness!
(2) Victory to the place of rest for all beings! To the giver of the bliss of
the state of Atman! To the ocean on which the waves of various
worlds appear!
(3) O the brother of the forlorn, please listen! You are the ocean of
eternal compassion and you are the beloved spouse of the science of
Spiritual Wisdom.
(4) You show this world to the man to whom you are not visible and
make manifest all this existence of name and form.
(5) Sir, it is called 'Hypnotism' when somebody's sight is baffled and
blinded, but the wonderful thing about you is that you make yourself
hidden from the world.
(6) O the Royal Teacher : It is all your magic that somebody sees all
this as illusion and somebody experiences the self-realisation, but
you are the totality of all this Universe: To you who are like this, I
offer my salutations!
(7) We know only one thing. What is called water in this world has got
the taste because of you and the earth has got the quality of
sustaining because of you.
(8) The Sun and the Moon which are like the shining shells of the
universe, get their brilliance from you only.
(9) The movement of the wind is your divine power and the sky also
plays hide and seek in your wholeness of existence.
