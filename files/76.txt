higher meditation.
अजुन उवाच -
ि थतप य का भाषा समािध थ य क
े शव|
ि थतधीः िक
ं पभाषेत िकमासीत वजेत िकम्
Arjuan asked - “O Keshava, what is the definition or sign of a man with steady intellect and of
him who is in the trance? Who can be called a man of stable intellect? How does he sit and how does
he walk? (How does he behave in daily life) (54)
(285) At that time Arjuna said to God, O God, I am now going to ask something about this state of
mind. Please, O, The reservoir of blessing! Please give me the answer.
(286) Then Achyuta said, “O The crowned one! Ask freely and happily what exactly you wish to
ask, with all the eagerness of mind.
(287) Upon this, Partha said to Shri Krishna, “What is the description of “stitha-pradnya?” (A man
of steady intellect? How to recognize him?)
(288) And how to recognize him who is of a sane and balanced mind and by what signs can we make
out that man, who enjoys the bliss of trance all the time?
(289) In what manner he sits? In what manner he conducts himself? O, the spouse of Laxmi, please
tell me this.
(290) Then Narayana, the incarnation of Brahman who is the resort of six kinds of glory, said -
शीभगवानुवाच-
पजहाित यदा कामा सवा पाथ मनोगतान्|
आ म येवा मना तु ः ि थतप तदो यते
Shri Bhagwan said - “O Partha, when one totally drops all the cravings and desires from his mind
and is satisfied in the self, then he is called of stable mind. (55)
(291) He said “O Arjuna, the desire which is much developed in the mind becomes an impediment
to self-realization and bliss.
(292) One who is always satisfied and has a mind complete, wholesome, and healthy, if he becomes
a slave to sense-objects, he falls into the mire of over-indulgence.
