स एवायं मया तेऽ योगः पो ः पुरातनः|
भ ोऽिस मे सखा चेित रह यं ेतदु मम्
The same ancient yoga which is a supreme secret, has today been imparted to you by me, because
you are my devotee and friend. (3)
(27) O, the son of Kunti, we have told you today, the same yoga in essence; have no doubt about it.
(28) This yoga is the most sacred secret of my heart, but when you are so dear to me, how can I keep
it concealed from you?
(29) O! The great archer! You are the icon of love, the heart of devotion and the spirit of friendship.
(30) You are the resort of faith. How can we avoid telling it to you, though we are intent upon
fighting here on the warfront?
(31) Therefore, it is necessary to keep aside this turmoil of the battle for some time and not to mind
the noise here; but to remove your ignorance first.
