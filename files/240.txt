is considered its younger brother.
(265) People feel sure that the ephemeral pleasures of senses which are actually visible are the seats
or the base of the heavenly happiness, but the bliss in Brahman cannot be compared to the
pleasures of Indra which falls too short.
(266) But when yogis put that heavenly happiness on the palm of the divine vision which is opened
by their realization of Brahman, and check its weight, they find that it is very light.
(267) Then those yogis consider that heavenly happiness is not worth much and use it as a stepping
stone to climb the greatest seat of absolute Brahman.
(268) This is the combined glory of all the nature, full of creatures and things. Even the Brahma and
Shankara observe penance for possessing it. Only the yogis are worthy of this and that is the
actual happiness they enjoy.
(269) & (270) Saint Dnyaneshwar says - Lord Shri Krishna who is the giver of beauty to all arts,
who is the image of highest bliss, the life of the universal life, the root source of omniscience, and
the lamp of light to the Yadava families, told Arjuna this secret knowledge.
(271) Thus Sanjaya was reporting to the king Dhritarashtra, everything that was happening on the
battlefield of Kurushektra. - Dnyanadeva requests - Please listen to it further.
इित शीम गव ीतासूपिनष सु ब िव ायां योगशा ते शीक

Thus in the Upanishads sung by the Lord, in the science of knowledge of Brahman, in the scripture
of yoga, and in the dialogue between Shri Krishna and Arjuna, the eighth chapter by name The Yoga
of Akshara Brahman, comes to an end. (8)
