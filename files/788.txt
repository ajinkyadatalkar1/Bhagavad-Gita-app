with thousands of rays which are the various attitudes of their minds.
(1300) He illuminates all the three worlds in all the three states of waking, dreaming and sleep, and
awakens all these pilgrims who are walking on the mistaken illusory path of worldly life.
(1301) The God, like the Sun, illumines the lotus flowers of objects, in the lake of water of visible
objects, and feeds continuously the black-bees having six feet of five senses and the mind, with
the honey of joy.
(1302) But enough of this imagery. The god who dwells in the heart, wears the veil of ego at all
times.
(1303) Remaining hidden behind the screen of his own Maya, he pulls all the ropes and shows on the
stage of the world a grand puppet dance of eighty-four lakhs of creatures.
(1304,1305) He decorates every creature with properly fitting apparel of body, to which the creature
becomes attached and thinks that he is his body only.
(1306) Just as a thread gets entangled with another thread, or a blade of grass gets twisted with
another blade of grass, or a child tries to grasp its reflection in the water,
(1307) The Jeeva sees his own shadow which is his body and starts thinking that he is his body only.
(1308) In this way the God, who dwells in the heart of every being, puts Jeevas on the machinery,
the wheel of the body and moves the process of Karma and its results.
