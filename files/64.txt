आ यव चैनम यः शृणोित|
शु वा येनं वेद न चैव कि त्
Someone perceives this spirit and marvels at it, someone else describes this as wonderful; some
one else hears about it and becomes astonished; while there are some who know it not, even when
they hear its description. (29)
(172) Some become still while seeing this and forget all the beings in the world.
(173) Some describe it and in that way, their mind becomes repentant, and their attention is
continuously merged into it without a moment’s break.
