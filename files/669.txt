(230) And when the mind is beautiful and without any dark spot, like the full moon who may be
devoid of its dark spots and travels gracefully in the sky,
(231) In that state of mind, the cutting pains of maintaining ascetic desirelessness drop away, the
wandering of the mind stops and only the fullness of self-knowledge remains within the mind.
(232) Therefore, the mouth which is to be opened only to discuss the various scriptures, does not
take the reins of speech, but keeps quiet.
(233) As self-realisation has been attained, the quality of the mind is lost, and just as salt is
dissolved in water, the mind is merged into the Atman.
(234) In such a condiion, how can the feelings and attitudes, which run towards objects through the
path of sense organs, ever arise?
(235) Therefore, just as there are no hair on the palm, there are no thoughts about objects in such a
mind, and there is purity of feeling.
(236) O Arjuna, what more should I say? When the mind attains such a state, then that is the right
quality of mental penance.
(237) The Lord said, "Now let this be. I have completely told you the signs of mental penance.
(238) Thus, the general classification of penance by way of the divisions of the body, the speech and
the mind is explained to you.
(239) Now I shall tell you about penance in its triple manifestation according to the three qualities,
to which please listen with intelligence.
श या परया त ं तप ति िवधं नरैः|
अफलाकाि िभयु ै ः साि वक
ं प रच ते
The penance, which is performed by men is of three types. That which is performed with great
faith with concentrated mind but not expecting fruit, is called Sattwic penance(17)
(240) O the wise one, the very three-fold penance, which I have told you about, should be performed
with great faith, but without hoping for the fruit.
(241) And when it is observed with piety and full belief in god, then it is called Sattwic penance, by
wise-men.
स कारमानपूजाथ तपो द भेन चैव यत्|
िकयते तिदह पो ं राजसं चलमधुवम्
