न िह सं यसनादेव िसि ं समिधग छित
By not starting action at all, it is not that a man can reach the action-free state; nor does a man
reach the state of trance simply by relinquishing all actions. (4)
(45) Unless a person performs his ordained duties, if he says that he would give up all actions, he
will not be free of action like a Master.
(46) Because, O Arjuna, it is foolishness to believe that without doing our proper duty we can attain

say that I will give up or accept the action, because whatever is action as such, it is all dependent
