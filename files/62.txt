expecting to meet him (but cannot do so.)
(149) He is always unreachable by mind, cannot be captured by any penance, O Arjuna, he is
limitless and he is the best and the greatest “Purushottama.”
(150) He is without and beyond the there qualities. He is beyond any form. He is without any
distortion and is All.
(151) O Arjuna, he should be understood as such and seen as being all the things. Then only, all your
sorrow will cease to exist.
अथ चैनं िन यजातं िन यं वा म यसे मृतम्|
तथािप वं महाबाहो नैवं शोिचतुमहिस
And O, the brave man of powerful arms, if you suppose that Atman is subject to be permanently
born or permanently dead, then also, knowing him like this, you should not be sorry. (26)
(152) And if you do not think him to be like this but think that end is inevitable for him, then also you
should not grieve for him, O, son of Pandu.
(153) Then just as there is constant flow of the waters of Ganges, there is this constant process of
birth-life-and death.
(154) That water is an unbroken flow at the beginning; and in the end it remains implicit in the sea,
and in between, it is continuously seen to be flowing.
(155) As these three aspects are continuously connected, know that no being or thing is devoid of
these three states at any time.
(156) Therefore, about all this state of affairs which is eternally in force, you need not lament.
(157) And even if you do not like this fact, of people being bound to birth and decay.
(158) There is no reason for you to be unhappy about it, because birth and death are inevitable.
जात य िह धुवो मृ युधुवं ज म मृत य च|
त मादप रहायऽय न वं शोिचतुमहिस
For, really, for anybody who is born, death is certain and for the dead, re-birth is also certain.
You should not, therefore, be sorry about what cannot be avoided. (27)
(159) That which is created becomes destroyed, and what is destroyed is seen again. This process is
just like the line of pots on a wheel on a well always rotating.
