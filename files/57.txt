न वेवाहं जातु नासं न वं नेमे जनािधपाः|
न चैव न भिव यामः सव वयमतः परम्
In fact, there was never any time when I was not, or when you or these kings were not. Nor is it a
fact that hereafter all of us shall not exist. (12)
(103) O Arjuna, I tell you. Please listen. "We, you and all these kings, without exception -
(104) - will always be as we are" or "definitely always be permanently dead" are both mistaken
concepts. When these concepts are discarded, the fact remains that “to be existing” and “to be
dead” are only illusions.
(105) Due to Maya this appears to come into existence and be destroyed; otherwise what is, is the
Reality which is not destructible.
(106) If water is disturbed by the wind, it becomes wavy; what new thing can be said to be born
there?
(107) And when the wind stops blowing and water becomes smooth, what can be said to have died
there? Please think about this.
देिहनोऽि मन् यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा|
तथा देहा तरपाि ध र तत न मु ित
Just as there are states of childhood, youth and old age of the body of the wielder of the body i.e.
the Atman; similarly, there is adoption of next body, The brave does not become disturbed by these
changes. (13)
(108) Please listen. The body is one, but it has various states according to the age. See this evident
fact.
(109) Here childhood is apparent which is then turned into youth, but the body does not die with
these changing states.
(110) Similarly, the bodies come and go on the base of the spirit, and he who knows this, does not
become sorry or deluded.
माता पशा तु कौ तेय शीतो णसुखदुःखदाः|

O Son of Kunti, the contacts between the senses and their objects, which produce the feeling of
cold or hot, pleasure or pain, etc., are transitory and they come and go. Therefore, O Bharata, ignore
