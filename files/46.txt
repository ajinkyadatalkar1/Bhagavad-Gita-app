(257) O God! Please listen to another great sin which is committed. By the downfall of one family,
other families are also by association losers of the code of good conduct.
(258) Just as fire which burns one house spreads to other houses and turns them into ashes,
(259) Similarly the association of this family with other people causes them also to be sinners.
(260) Arjuna said that such a family beset by various defects and defaults, becomes worthy of only
fearsome hell.
(261) He further said, “Once that family falls into purgatory, it cannot escape from it even at the end
of the Age. Such is the continuous degradation resultant by massacre of the whole family.
(262) Even after listening to there various bad results, should we not fear sins? should we turn our
hearts as cold and hard as steel? Think about it!
(263) When this body for which the pleasures of the kingdom are desired is itself impermanent,
should we not abhor it, knowing the sin involved in it?
(264) And please tell me, is it a negligible sin committed by us that, with an intention to kill we have
stared at these elders?
यिद मामपतीकारमश तं श तपाणयः|
धातरा ा रणे ह यु त मे ेमतरं भवेत्
It would be a matter of greater welfare for me if the sons of Dhrutarashtra, armed with weapons,
will kill me in the battle while I hold no weapons and offer no resistance. (46)
(265) Now, it is better to throw my weapons and suffer their arrows, than to live any longer.
(266) It does not matter if death does meet me while doing so, but we do not dare commit such a sin.
(267) Seeing thus all his relations in front of him, Arjuna said- This enjoying the kingdom is only
hell, and nothing else!
संजय उवाच
एवमु वाऽ जुनः सं ये रथोप थ उपािवशत्|
िवसृ य सशरं चापं शोकसंिव नमानसः
Sanjaya said - "Having spoken thus, Arjuna, with his mind completely affected by grief, threw
down his bow and arrows and sat down beside his chariot, on the battlefield. (47)
