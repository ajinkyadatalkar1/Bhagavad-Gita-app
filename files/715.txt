(346) And O Pandava, blossoming is a better stage in the case of a lotus and still better is the
fragrance and the beautiful pollen. (attracting black-bees)
(347) Poetic skill is better in language, but power of appreciation and loving nature is still better,
while a touch of genius, the 'otherness' enhances the quality of both these.
(348) Similarly, intellect is supreme in the inner faculties, it shines further if it is supported by
organs which are very sensitive.
(349) But better still it is if the deities presiding over these organs are benedictary.
(350) Because there are deities like Sun for the eyes, who control and empower all the organs by
their blessings,
(351) The "hosts of gods" is the fifth cause for action, which, O Arjuna, you should know- so said
the Lord. (Note- These deities are working according to god's plan for the world).
(352) Thus I have told you the five faced mine or source of actions, in a way that you will
understand, which you have heard.
( 353) Now I shall tell you the five reasons or purposes of actions which come to play their role as
these five causes further develop.
शरीरवा नोिभय कम पारभते नरः|
या यं वा िवपरीतं वा प चैते त य हेतवः
These are five reasons for all the actions, may they be proper or unjustifiable, which a man starts
either with his body, speech or mind. (15)
(354) My dear, with the advent of spring, the trees have new tender leaves, then there are bunches of
flowers and further, the fruit is also borne!
(355) The rainy season brings clouds, by clouds there is rain and because of rain, there is the
pleasure of plenty of crop.
(356) The east brings the dawn, the dawn presided by god Arun, brings the sun on the horizon and by
sun, the whole day is brought forth.
(357) Similarly, O Pandava, mind creates the plan of action, and by that wish, the lamp of speech is
lit.
(358) Then that lamp of speech shows clearly the way of doing all actions, and then the doer starts
the action.
