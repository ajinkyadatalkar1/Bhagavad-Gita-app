(77) Really speaking, he was quite convinced about the main doctrine,
but his loving heart could not accept the possible stoppage of speech
by the Lord.
(78) Even if the calf is satisfied, it wants the cow not to go away.
Intimate one-pointed love is always like this.
(79) That love speaks without reason. It wants to see again what it has
once seen and by experiencing love of the beloved, it is increased
further and further.
(80) Such is the nature of love and Partha was the very image of such
love, and therefore, he became uneasy with the thought that the Lord
might stop speaking.
(81) Through dialogue, Arjuna was experiencing that thing which is not
possible in practical life, just as we see our own face only in the
mirror.
(82) But that happiness was about to be stopped if dialogue ceased.
How can Arjuna, who was now addicted to that happiness, tolerate
that thing?
(83) Therefore, under the pretext of asking about 'renunciation' and
'abandoning', he caused the fold of the cloth of Geeta to be reopened.
(84) Sirs, this eighteenth chapter is not merely a chapter, but the whole
Geeta brought into a summary form. When the calf wants to drink
milk, how can the cow wait for long to give it?
(85) Similarly, Arjuna turned his attention back to the Geeta, when it
was about to come to an end. Anyway, does the owner not give what
his servant really wants?
