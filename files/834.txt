doings and insults done by her son 'Shishupal' but if he persists, Krishna
would slay him. Shishupal objected to the highest honours being given
to Krishna by Pandavas at the time of Rajasooya Yadnya, and standing
up, vehemently profusely abused Krishna in the open conference of
various Kings. At that time, as the insults numbered more than hundred,
Krishna used his supreme weapon Sudarshana disc and cut the throat of
Shishupal. The wonderful thing which happened at that time was that a
brilliant ball of light came out of the body of Shishupal and entered
swiftly into the divine body of Krishna. This story tells us that even
hatred, if it is one-pointed and extreme, towards God, it also drives the
soul to merge into the God.

By Arjuna's promise, the fire got more life-time -
A king by name Shwetaki, performed a sacrifice of the duration of 12
years. As many rich foods with ghee etc. were offered into the sacrificial
fire, there was loss of appetite of the fire and unless he got wood to burn
he would not have survived. The Brahma told him that if he could get
the forest named Khandava to burn, which was having many medicinal
herbs, his appetite would be revived. At that time, the fire taking the
body of a Brahmin, approached Arjuna for allowing him to consume
that forest. His request was granted. The forest was gutted by fire and
the story tells us that the fire thus became efficient again.
