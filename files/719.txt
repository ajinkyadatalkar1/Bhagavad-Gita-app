(400) Similarly when we want to find out ourselves again, we can do so by looking at the saints, and
we should praise them and hear about them at all times.
(401) So, there is such a man who is not bound by actions though he performs actions just as the
delicate skin of the eyes does not prevent the sight.
(402) So, I shall tell you logically and explicitly the nature of such a man who is so free; so, please
