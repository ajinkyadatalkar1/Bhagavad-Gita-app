from pneumonia, because it becomes poison if administered to him.
(185) Similarly if wrong action is done at a time when it is not suitable, your real welfare is
destroyed. Therefore, you should be very alert at this time.
(186) Why are you suffering from pangs of compassion?? You should see what is your bounden duty,
by performing which there is no stigma at any time.
(187) This is like walking by the right path so that there is no harm, or working in the light of a lamp,
so that you do not stumble.
(188) Similarly, O Partha, when you do your own duty, there is fulfillment of all your aspirations in
a very easy manner.
(189) So, you should see this. For Kshatriyas like you, there is nothing more befitting than a
righteous war.
(190) Be free of any deceptive thoughts. Take up the fight with renewed force. Now enough of this!
Why should we go on speaking, when everything is quite evident?
य छया चोपप नं वग ारमपावृतम्|
सुिखनः ितयाः पाथ लभ ते यु मी शम्
O Partha, Those Kshatriyas who luckily get the opportunity of such a war which is like the open
door of heaven, are really happy! (32)
(191) O Arjuna, see this present battle. This is your good fortune. It is as if the great treasure of
Religion is manifest before you.
(192) Why! This is not only a battle. It is as if, by your bravery, heaven is manifest in this shape.
(193) Or, being attracted by your virtues and through great liking for you, this is virtually the dame
fame who has come to marry you.
(194) Kshatriya has to do much meritorious work and then only he gets opportunity of such a battle.
It is as if the wish-stone is found while casually walking by the street.
(195) Or, it is like nectar falling in the mouth when one opens the mouth while yawning. This battle
is like that.
अथ चे विममं ध य संगामं न क र यिस|
ततः वधम क ित च िह वा पापमवा यिस
