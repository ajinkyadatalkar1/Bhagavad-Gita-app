the darkness of hope and desire.
कामै तै तै त ानाः पप तेऽ यदेवताः|
तं तं िनयममा थाय पक
ृ या िनयताः वया
Being deprived of their knowledge by their particular desires and controlled and conditioned by
their own nature, they worship other deities by following the code and the method of their particular
worship. (20)
(139) When the desire enters his mind through the greed for fruit, lamp of knowledge is extinguished
by its force.
(140) When they are thus completely merged in the dense darkness, they miss me though I am near
them touching them and they start worshipping other deities with all their mind and soul.
(141) Such people are already slaves to Maya, and over and above, being greedy of enjoyment of
sense objects, they become very miserably ensnared, and they worship other deities with great
show of love.
(142) They themselves think about various rules and regulations to be followed for that worship and
with extreme fuss, they collect various apparatus useful for their ceremony. Thus they really offer
various articles to those deities with diligent care.
यो यो यां यां तनुं भ ः श याऽिचतुिम छित|
त य त याचलां श ां तामेव िवदधा यहम्
It is I who nurture in his mind that particular faith, with which everybody desires to worship his
peculiar deity with love. (21)
( 143) He who has interest to worship the other deity for some fruit, is given by me his interest in
that deity.
(144) He does not know that I am that God or Goddess and holds his separate faith in his heart.
स तया श या यु त याराधनमीहते|
लभते च ततः कामा मयैव िविहतान् िह तान्
Being enriched by that faith, he desires to worship that God and eventually gets the fruits of his
worship, which fruits are provided by me only. (22)
(145) Then being armed with that faith, he scientifically worships that particular deity continuously
till he gets success in his undertaking.
