(1804) There, Shri Ramchandra, the king, who belongs to the family lineage of the Yadus and who is
the supporter of all arts, is ruling with justice.
(1805) There, Dnyanadeo the son (disciple) of Shri Nivrittinatha belonging to the Sampradaya of
Shri Mahesh (Lord Shankara) has given the ornament of indigenous language Marathi for Geeta.
(1806) Thus in the town of Mahabharata, in the section dedicated to Bheeshma, which is well-
known, there was a good dialogue between the Lord Shrikrishna and Arjuna.
(1807) That is the essence of Upanishads, the maternal home of all scriptures, and a sacred lake in
which the sages of the order of Adepts, called Paramhansa, happily enjoy their residence.
(1808) Dnyandev, the disciple and the servant of NivrittiNath, says that here the Eighteenth chapter
of that Geeta comes to an end.
(1809) He prays that further on, by the riches of the merits of this book, all the beings may be totally
happy and may fulfill their life.
(1810) In the Shaka year of twelve hundred and twelve, this commentary was written by
Dnyaneshwara and Sat-Chidanand Baba did the work of a scribe of this book, with great respect.
The Epilogue by Saint Eknath
(1) In the Shaka year of fifteen hundred and six in the Samvatsara called TÂ¢rana, the book
Geeta-Dnyaneshwari was corrected, with all respects, by Eknath, the
disciple of Janardana.
(2) Originally, the book was very correct, but by the lapse of time, in
the process of copying and recitation, it became ridden with errors.
By removing those errors, this Dnyaneshwari text was arrived at, as a
clean copy.
(3) I bow to the unblemished Dnyaneshwara by reading whose
commentary on Geeta, the devoted souls who want to know the
meaning of the book, attain that knowledge.
(4) The writing of this copy was completed at the town Pratishthana on
the banks of the river Godavari on the most auspicious day of
Kapilashahthi in the month of Bhadrapada.
