Thus I have told you the secret of the secret knowledge. Now having listened to all this fully you
may do as you wish. (63)
(1323) This is the juice of all the spiritual literature, by name Geeta, by learning which the jewel
which is Atman is directly perceptible.
(1324) It is famous throughout the world because it is the knowledge which is most honourably so
declared in Vedas.
(1325) This is that knowledge by which light the intellect etc. can see and by the rising of which, I
who am all-seeing can also be seen.
(1326) This is that self knowledge. This is the most secret treasure of mine, who am really abstract,
invisible, unmanifest! But how can I keep it from you?
(1327) Therefore O Pandava, we have revealed this hidden treasure to you, because we are
motivated by compassion.
(1328) When a mother is overwhelmed by her love for her child, she also talks in a babbling manner
freely with it. Then would not our love provoke us to speak out like it?
(1329) Here, as if the sky should be put in a strainer, the nectar should be peeled, or the test by fire
should be asked to undergo the test by fire.
(1330) Or even in the eyes of the Sun, by whose light every particle in all the worlds becomes
lighted, one should put divine ointment.
(1331) In that manner, this sheer truth is told by me, who am omniscient, after thoroughly considering
all the aspects of this knowledge! O Dhananjaya!
(1332) Now you may do as you wish after fully considering all this and giving your thought to it.
(1333) On listening to this talk of the Lord, Arjuna remained quiet. Then the Lord said, "O! You are
not easily convinced!"
(1334) If a man while dinning says that he is satisfied though he is not; he will go hungry because of
his shyness and further he will be a liar.
(1335) Similarly if a disciple hesitates to ask questions to an omniscient Guru, feeling that it is a
great burden of obligation that the Guru has taught so much.
