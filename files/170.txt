(13)
(201) Then the palms of both the hands like two hollow leaf-pots automatically rest on the knees and
the shoulders appear to be raised to some extent.
(202) The head appears to have been lowered between the raised shoulders and arms and the eyes
begin to be closed gradually.
(203) The upper eyelids are lowered a bit but the lower eyelids are open, as a result of which the
eyes appear to be half-open.
(204) Then the eye-sight remains slightly inward and if it turns outwards, it automatically rests on
the tip of the nose.
(205) Thus as the eyesight is held up inside and being unable to go completely outward towards
other directions it has to rest on that tip.
(206) Then the very desire to see towards all the directions or to look at any form whatsoever,
automatically comes to an end.
(207) Then the neck is pressed down as if caught in that position and the chin rests being pressed in
the depression near the throat. The neck becomes stiff and the chin begins to pressurise the chest.
(208) Then the wind pipe is suffocated and O Son of Pandu, this posture is called Jalandhara-
Bandha.
(209) In this position, the navel is pressed out but the stomach becomes flat while the region of heart
becomes enlarged.
(210) In this position, there is a posture called ‘V
odhiana’ in which there is stillness in the region of
lower abdomen, between navel and anus.
पशा ता मा िवगतभीब चा रवते ि थतः|
मनः संय य मि च ो यु आसीत म परः
Firm in the vow of complete chastity and fearless, keeping himself perfectly calm and with the
mind held in restraint and fixed on me, the yogi should be absorbed in meditation on me. (14)
(211) In this way, there is a certain change of appearance due to study of yoga in the outer form of
the body and at the same time the attitudes of the mind also undergo a kind of slowing down.
(212) The imagination becomes nullified, the outward movement becomes quiet and the mind with
the body becomes still.
