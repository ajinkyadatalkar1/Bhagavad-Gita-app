(12) Therefore, already knowing as to what question Arjuna was going to ask, the Lord had kept his
answer ready to be served on a platter.
(13) As soon as the little child looks at his mother, and puts its mouth near her breast, the mother
herself feels the hunger of the child. It is not the case that the child tells her that it is hungry and
then she feeds it.
(14) Therefore, there is no wonder that there is tremendous love in the mind of the Guru, the ocean of
compassion, towards the disciple. Let it be. Now please listen to what Lord said.
शीभगवानुवाच -
अ रं ब परमं वभावोऽ या ममु यते|
भूतभावो वकरो िवसगः कमसंि तः
The Lord said, “The supreme Indestructible is Brahma; one’s own self (the individual soul) is
called Adhyatma, and the discharge of spirits, (Visarga), which brings forth the existence of beings, is
called Karma (Action). (3)
(15) The universal Lord said, “That which is in this body which has various openings, but does not
leak out.
(16) On the other hand, it is so subtle that we cannot call it void or zero, and it is as if put in the
strainer of the sky.
(17) But even though it is so rare and thin, it does not fall from the bag of Prapancha. (world made of
five elements) That is the absolute Brahman.
(18) Even if a form is created, it does not become subject to birth nor knows it and even if the form
disappears, it does not disappear.
(19) O Arjuna, that principle of Brahman which is eternally in its self-evident state is called
Adhyatma.
(20) Then as in the clear sky, suddenly without apparent causation, various clouds of many colours
appear,
(21) Similarly from that formless pure Brahman, various elements including Prakriti (nature) and ego
come into existence and the formation of universe begins.
(22) In the fertile land of Brahman which is originally without a ripple of thought, there grows the
basic seed of the thought, “I will become many”, breaking the virgin land, and then it develops
into cluster of universes.
