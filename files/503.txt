(173) The most fearsome bondage of the quality of Rajas imprisons the Atman in this body. Now
please listen to the great power of the quality of Tamas.
तम व ानजं िवि मोहनं सवदेिहनाम्|
पमादाल यिनदािभ ति नब नाित भारत
O Bharata, please know that Tamas is produced by ignorance, which confuses all the beings and
it binds the soul by error, laziness and sleep. (8)
(174) That which causes the vision of ordinary worldly duties also to be blinded, and which is like
dark clouds of the night of darkness of confusion,
(175) That which has the nucleous of ignorance at his heart, and by one single cause of which this
universe is misguided and deluded,
(176) That which is the code word for thoughtlessness, which is the glass of the wine of stupidity
and which is the weapon for baffling all Jeevas-
(177) O Partha, that is Tamas, which by its evil skill, binds persons who are proud of their bodies,
from all directions.
(178) Once this goes on increasing everywhere in the living and inanimate things in the universe,
there is hardly anything else getting any scope there.
(179) By its effects, a man has heaviness in all his sense- organs and action organs, has stupidity in
his mind and there is a very hard core of laziness in all his body.
(180 He lazily reclines and twists his limbs in his lassitude, has absolutely no interest in doing any
work, and sleeps yawning continuously.
(181) O the crowned one! Though his eyes are open, he does not look at anything in particular and
gets up saying "yes!" though nobody has called him.
(182) Just as a big stone when fallen on the ground, does not move on its side, he also does not move
at all when once he goes to sleep.
(183) Even if there may be a big earthquake or the sky may fall upon him, he lies down like a log of
wood, and does not get up.
(184) When once he makes himself lazily listless and goes into his drowsiness he does not remain
aware of right and wrong. He has only one interest in his mind and that is just to continue his
sleep.
