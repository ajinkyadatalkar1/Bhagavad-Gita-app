into being by its power only.
(935) Or, O Pandava, it is everything in everything and there is no place for the sense of duality in it.
(936) As soon as it is perceived, the observer and the object of observation become one.
(937) And it becomes the knowledge, the knower and the knowable, and it is the state which is
attained by knowledge.
(938) When the accouts are tallied, the figures on both the sides become one, so, in it the seeker, the
seeking and the thing to be sought become one unity.
(939) O Arjuna, it is that about which we cannot utter the word "duality" and it is always established
in the heart, as nucleus in all the beings.
इित ेतं तथा ानं ेयं चो ं समासतः|
म एति ाय म ावायोपप ते
I have thus told you summarily what is the field and the knowledge as well as the object of
knowledge, and by knowing this, my devotee attains the same state as mine. (18)
(940) O the man of wisdom, thus I have explained to you what is the field, by analysing all its
components.
(941) And afterwards, as you see, I have told you the signs of knowledge also.
(942) Then I have told you so many signs of ignorance that you were completely bored by the
description.
(943) And now I have explained to you the nature of the knowable, very clearly.
(944) O Arjuna, when all this knowledge is really understood by the intellect, my devotees get an
acute desire to come to me.
(945) They give up their attachment to the worldly things including their body, also forget their
separateness and have made their life a slave in my service.
(946) They then forget themselves and in the end become "me" only.
(947) Please understand that I have told this way of becoming one with me, as the simplest and
easiest path.
(948) It is like preparing steps to a steep cliff, or to erect a platform to sit at a higher place or to use
a boat to cross the swollen waters of a river.
