in the form of these words!"- so says Dnyandeva.
इित शीम गव ीतासूपिनष सु ब िव ायां योगशा ते
शीक
ृ णाजुनसंवादे पुराणपु षो मयोगो नाम पंचदशोऽ यायः
Thus in the Upanishads sung by the Lord in the science of the knowledge of Brahman, in the
scripture of Yoga, and in the dialogue between the Lord Shrikrishna and Arjuna, the fifteenth chapter
by name "The Yoga of the Supreme Person" comes to an end.

Chapter - 16
The Yoga of the Division of Divine and
Demonic Qualities
(1) My Guru who, like the wonderful Sun, has arisen and is making the
recognition of mundane universe disappear and is causing the lily of
non-duality to blossom! I shall now offer my salutations to him!
(2) This is the Sun who makes the dark night of ignorance dissolve,
devours the stars of knowledge as well as ignorance and causes the
auspicious day of self-knowledge dawn for men of wisdom.
(3) When the day dawns by the power of this Sun, he gives the birds of
Jeevas the visions of their reality and they leave their nests which are
of the identification with their body.
(4) This is the Sun by the rising of whom the blue-beetle of spirit
caught in the lotus flower of the emotional body, becomes free.
(5,6) This is the Sun by the rising of whom the Chakrawaka couple of
intellect and knowledge, which was separated from each other by the
crevices of words on both the banks of the river of duality, is joined
together by the sky of spirituality being illuminated.
