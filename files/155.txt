just like a dialogue between the deaf and the dumb.
(27) But now I need not enlarge upon this argument. It is not necessary
to valuate the quality of listeners, in such a way because all the
audience which is desireless, is naturally rightfully entitled to it.
(28) Others, except those who have given up all the pleasures of
ordinary life and heaven, because of their deep interest in self-
knowledge, will not be able to appreciate the sweetness of this
subject.
(29) Ordinary people will not understand the meaning of this book
because the crows do not recognize the beauty of the Moon and only
the bird Chakora it is, that can enjoy the moon-light.
(30) Thus, only the persons who are knowledgeable can understand this
subject, while to the ignorant it is like a foreign town, and therefore it
is not necessary for me to speak more about this.
(31) But in the flow of discourse, I spoke out a few words for which the
kind and pious listeners may, please, forgive me and tolerate. Now I
will describe, what the Lord Shrikrishna said to Arjuna.
(32) That talk of Shrikrishna is very difficult for higher intellect also
and, therefore, it is well nigh impossible to put it into words, but by
the light of the blessings of Nivrittinatha, I will be able to see it.
(33) That which the eyes cannot see, can be seen without eyes, but for
that, there should be the power of knowledge which is beyond
the senses.
(34) Please see this - The gold which even the alchemist cannot get, is
found in the iron only, if there is the magic stone Parees in our hand.
