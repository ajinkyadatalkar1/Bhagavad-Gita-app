(276) The lotus blooms and indicates sunrise and lets its fragrant honey be sucked and looted by
black-bees.
(277) Similarly the actions appearing to be taking place on the Atman, actually happen to be caused
by various 'causes' continuously. They are five and we will explain to you all the five causes.
प चैतािन महाबाहो कारणािन िनबोध मे|
सां ये क
ृ ता ते पो ािन िस ये सवकमणाम्
O the man of powerful arms! There are five causes for all the actions to be fructified, as told in
the Sankhya philosophy which is one of the final doctrines of the Vedas. Please understand these from
me. (13)
(278) Perhaps, you may already be knowing these five causes which are declared by scriptures with
great emphasis.
(279) They are loudly chanted to the accompaniment of drums of philosophical discussions, in the
stronghold of Vedanta in the city of the Veda, who is the King.
(280) As these are the causes for all the actions to be completed in this world; Atman, the king
should not be taken as connected with the actions.
(281) O the crowned one! As these causes are thus made very famous by propaganda, I think that you
should better know them.
(282) And when I am the Gem of Life available to you, where is the point in advising you to hear
about them from somebody else's mouth?
(283) When there is a mirror in front of you, where is the necessity of asking others how you look
and thus giving their eyes the credit?
(284) I present myself in the way in which, and by the imagination with which, my devotee sees
anything; and you have me here as a toy to play with.
(285) While speaking thus ardently, the Lord Shrikrishna forgot himself, and Arjuna was simply
merged in the blissful joy.
(286) Just as in the moon-light, even a mountain of "Somakant" stone may dissolve and become a
lake,
(287) In the same way, by removal of the wall between the happiness and the self-experience,
Arjuna himself became the very image of happiness.
