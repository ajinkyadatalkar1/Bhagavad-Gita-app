(670) Please listen, O my friend form Dwarka city! This meeting again with your beautiful form is
not an ordinary meeting, but a great shower of rain to the tree which was dried up.
(671) I was nearly broken to pieces by thirst, and this form of yours is like getting the sea of nectar,
and now I am assured that I am living,
(672) In the garden of consciousness, the creepers of joy are being cultivated and I have now made
friendship with happiness.
शीभगवानुवाच-
सुदुदशिमदं पं वानिस य मम|
देवा अ य य प य िन यं दशनकांि णः
The Lord said- "Really, extremely rare is the luck of seeing my universal form which you have
seen. Even gods are always having great desire to be able to have this vision. (52)
(673) When Arjuna said like this, the Lord said, ‘‘What do you mean? You should keep your faith
and love for the universal form and then turn here to my small human form!
(674) And then meet this my human form, with the mind which is completely alone and unattached. O
the husband of Subhadra! Have you forgotten all that I taught you?
(675) O Arjuna! You are really blind. Even when you got the mountain Meru, you had a wrong idea
that it is small.
(676) The great universal manifestation which we have exhibited before you is not possible for the
Lord Shankara to see even after severe penance.
(677) And O the wielder of a beautiful crown! Yogis undertake the hardest task of following the
eight- faceted yoga, but they have no capacity to see it.
(678) Gods keep on hoping to see this universal Reality, and in that hope only, much time elapses.
(679) Just as the bird Chatak looks up with thirsty eagerness towards clouds, similarly with folded
hands of aspiration placed on their hearts,
(680) Gods, with great eagerness, repeat to themselves day and night, their desire to meet this Great
God!
(681) But even in dream, nobody has ever seen anything like this universal form and you have easily
seen it.
