(543) Or just as a man beaten by somebody retaliates and runs after that man to beat him in return,
this man takes drastic steps to avoid rebirth.
(544) Just as a self-righteous man cannot take insult quietly, he is always lamenting and ashamed
about this birth which he had to take.
(545) And he becomes very alert about avoiding death by thinking that the death which may come
after some time, may perhaps come today also;
(546) Which precautionary attitude is like a man who, while standing on the bank prepares himself
to swim by girding his loins, when he is told that the water in the river is very deep;
(547) Or, a soldier, before going into the battlefield makes all the arrangements of holding the shield
etc. to protect himself from the future attack of weapons;

man keeps himself always seriously aware of his possible death.
(553) So, he who avoids rebirth during this birth only and kills death by being dead to attachments,
remains ever alive in his own detached state.
(554) There is no shortage of knowledge in his case because he has no fear of birth and death at all.
(555) He is aware of oldage which has not yet touched him, and apprehends at the future plight while
he is in the prime of his youth,
(556) He says to himself- "The well-built strong body which is mine today is going to be as dry as a
dried piece of wafer,
(557) These legs and arms are going to be as useless as the business of a man of bad luck, and my
