(63) Their task is like quenching thirst by thirst, hunger by hunger, and like churning wind by bare
hands throughout day and night.
(64) Or like sleeping in the hot sun in the day, to enjoy the 'bliss' of control of senses, and to have
friendship with trees.
(65) Or like taking bedsheets and covers, made of cold and heat, and staying under the heavy
showers of rain.
(66) Dear Arjuna, in short, it is like a woman going to die as "Sati" without her husband. This Yoga
is so hard.
(67) You see, there is no service to any Master to be performed nor is there any occasion to perform

(69) Therefore, for those who follow the path of this Yoga, there is reserved a specially selected
portion of great suffering.
(70) Dear Arjuna, just see! If a man is having no teeth in his mouth, and is given the grains made of
iron for eating, will his belly be filled or would he die?
(71) Similarly, is it possible to cross the vast sea by swimming merely by our arms or, is it possible
to walk in the sky?
(72) Will it be possible to rise to the high heaven of solar regions by entering a battle-field and not

plight of embodied beings, who undertake the worship of the abstract Brahman.
(74) But those who dare do all this, and try to embrace that which is completely abstract have to
suffer tremendously.
(75) Therefore, O Partha, those who are different from these and follow the path of devotion have
not to experience this type of suffering.
