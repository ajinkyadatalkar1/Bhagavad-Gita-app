Publisher's Note
It is with great pleasure and reverence to the great Saint
Dnyaneshwara, that we are presenting to our readers this English prose
translation of the monumental divine book Dnyaneshwari, as a sequence
to English translation of Dasboadh of Swami Ramdas - both books
translated by Shri Diwakar Ghaisas, the well-known author of many
books dealing with religious subjects. The language of Marathi
Dnyaneshwari is old and having many words in it, not well-understood
by today's readers, who will, if they read this English version, find it
easy to follow. It is needless to say that, as the translator has expressed
in his preface, this book is meant for readers not knowing Marathi
