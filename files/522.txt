ब णो िह पित ाऽहममृत या यय य च|
शा त य च धम य सुख यैकाि तक य च
For, I am the base of the imperishable Brahman, of the immortality of the eternal Religion and the
highest happiness in the Unity (27)
(404) O Pandava, when the term Brahman is used, it means me only. By all these terms (i.e.
immortality, eternal religion, highest happiness, etc.) only I am indicated.
(405) My dear Arjuna of the good inner consciousness! the Moon and the orb of its light are not two
separate things. Similarly there is no difference between "me" and the Brahman.
(406) My dear, that which is eternal, unmoving, clear, of the nature of religion, blissful, unlimited
and one without a second,
(407) That state which discrimination reaches after dismissing all other states, and that which is the
highest goal of knowledge - that is me!"
(408) Sanjaya said- "In this way the Lord Shrikrishna who is the relative of the devotees, was telling
to the brave Partha."
(409) Dhritarashtra said- "O Sanjaya, who has asked you about this? Why are you telling me all this
without being asked?
(410) Tell me about the victory (of Duryodhana) and relieve me of my gnawing anxiety." But
Sunjaya said in his mind. ‘‘Leave any hopes of victory now!’’
(411) Sanjaya was much wondering in his mind, "Alas! How bitter hatred this old man has in his
mind about the Lord!"
(412) Even then, let that kind Lord have pity on him and by drinking the medicine of discrimination
let the great disease of illusion be cured from his mind,"
(Dnyanadeva says -)
(413) While Sanjaya had such thoughts in his mind by remembering the dialogue between the Lord
Shrikrishna and Arjuna, his mind again became filled with an upsurge of joy.
(414) So, he will tell the teaching of Lord Shrikrishna, with this ever-increasing enthusiasm.
(415) And I, the disciple of Nivrutinatha, humbly say that I will make the meaning of each letter
understood by you; so, please listen.
