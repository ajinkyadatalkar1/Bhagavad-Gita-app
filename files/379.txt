नाहं वेदैन तपसा न दानेन न चे यया|
श य एवंिवधो द ं वानिस मां यथा
I am not possible to be seen as you have seen me, either through Vedas, or through penance or
through charity or through ritualistic sacrifices. (53)
(682) O Arjuna, no means can find a way to come up to this vision. Vedas together with the six

the shore as well as in the middle.
(690) Thus he has nothing other than myself as an object of worship, because for him the only
concept is ‘‘I am myself everything even to the level of tiny ant.’’ This is the real kind of
devotion.
(691) As soon as this oneness is experienced, there is naturally the same vision of me everywhere.
(692) Then as when some wood burns, that is called "fire" and nobody uses the word "wood" for
