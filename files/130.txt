whole world.
यथैधांिस सिम ोऽि नभ मसा क
ु तेऽजुन|
ानाि नः सवकमािण भ मसा क
ु ते तथा
As the fire blazing by the sticks, burns the fuel to ashes, so, O Arjuna, the fire of knowledge turns
all actions to ashes. (37)
(175) How far can small clouds stay intact before the great winds of the all-pervading storms which
raise the dust to heavens all over the worlds?
(176) Or will the fire in the ocean which burns water and makes it evaporate, be able to be put out
by grass or wood?
न िह ानेन स शं पिवतिमह िव ते|
त वयं योगसंिस ः कालेना मिन िवंदित
There is no more powerful purifier than knowledge in this world. He who is an accomplished
yogi (on the path of action), knows this in his inner consciousness in due course. (38)
(177) Therefore, it is futile and false to say that knowledge does not cleanse the dirt from human
mind. Actually there is no better purifier than knowledge.
(178) Just as in this world there is only one spirit and no second to it, so, in this world, knowledge
is the only one thing without a second.
(179) If the reflection of Sun can be as brilliant as that Sun, or if this sky can be tied and bundled up
in a sack,
(180) Or if a balance can be found to measure the weight of the Earth, then only, O son of Pandu,
some simile for knowledge can be had.
(181) Therefore, considering from various points of view, the sacredness of knowledge is surely
nowhere else, but in the knowledge itself.
(182) Just as we have to select nectar only, if we have to choose the best sweetness, similarly
knowledge can be compared with knowledge only.
(183) Now to talk further is to waste time. ‘‘When Shrikrishna was talking like this, Partha said -
“What you are saying is true.”
(184) But when Arjuna was thinking of asking “How to attain that knowledge”, Shri Krishna knew
what was in his mind.
