(1275) Then, though you are endless and eternally free, that will be lost to you and you will get a
hard beating by your pride about your body.
(1276) In the attachment with this physical body one has to suffer death every step and one does not
get a moment's respite.
(1277) Therefore, if you will not pay heed to my advice, you will be as good as dead without
actually dying.
यदहंकारमािश य न यो य इित म यसे|
िम यैष यवसाय ते पक
ृ ित वां िनयो यित
If taking resort to your pride, you will think, "I will not fight", your resolve is vain; your inborn
nature will put you to the yoke of the battle. (59)
(1278) Just as one who does not follow the rules of proper diet, increases the severity of the
disease, one who is against light, gives more strength to the darkness; if you disregard the sane
thought of discrimination, and give nourishment to your ego–
(1279) And call your body as Arjuna, the other's bodies as your kith and kin, and give the war a
name of sin or some bad thing,
(1280) O Dhananjaya, if you give these three names to these three and say - "I shall not fight"-
(1281) Even if you express your determination like this in this world, your inborn tendency, your
natural inclination will make your determination an empty, vain thing.
(1282) And is there any truth except sheer illusion in your concept that you are Arjuna, these are
your relatives and it is a great sin to kill these?
(1283) It is all very strange that you were ready to fight, then you wielded your weapons for fighting,
and after all this preparation now you should adamantly take a vow not to fight!
(1284) Therefore, there is no substance nor any sense from the worldly point of view also, in your
saying that you are not going to fight.
(1285) It is certain that your natural inclination will defeat your decision not to fight.
वभावजेन कौ तेय िनब ः वेन कमणा|
कतु ने छिस य मोहा क र य यवशोऽिप तत्
That action which you are not willing to undertake, only through your confused state of mind, you
will perform per force, being bound by your duty ordained by your nature (60)
