necessarily according to the rules of the scriptures, what type of inner essence of these worshippers
is, in the categories of Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas? (1)
(34) Arjuna who was thus accomplished in every field of life asked- "O the darkly beautiful god,
(like the leaf of TamÂ¢la tree), you are Brahman perceptible to our senses also! But
your statement seems to us as leaving many loopholes of doubt.

charity; or the practice of maintenance of sacred fire in the home, and fire sacrifice
etc.,
