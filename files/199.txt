(27) But let us not continue with the image. Now I will tell you in simple words so that you can
understand. This Prakriti creates the whole universe in order to be manifest by name and form.
(28) And this Prakriti or nature is totally one with me, there is no second there; and therefore, I am
the begining, the middle and the end of all this world.
म ः परतरं ना यि कि चदि त धन जय|
मिय सविमदं पोतं सूते मिणगणा इव
O Dhananjaya, there is nothing else besides me. Just like beads threaded into a garland, all this
world is held on the thread which is myself. (7)

(32) This universe is held by me just as beads made of gold are held together on a golden thread.

in all the Vedas, the sound in the sky and the manliness in men. (8)
I am the pure fragrance in the earth and the brilliance in fire. I am the life in all beings and the
penance in the monks. (9)
(33) Therefore I am the taste in water. I am the quality of touch in the wind and you should know that
the light which is in the Moon and the Sun is myself only.
(34) Similarly I am the natural good smell in the earth, the sound in the sky and OM in the Vedas.
(35) The manliness which is in man because of his pride, is spoken of as myself, by men of
