(279) For example, if we give a call to the sky, the sky never answers it or if we see somewhere
else and not in the mirror, the mirror does not give our reflection.
(280) Or a ball thrown into a shallow pool of water does not rebound;
(281) Or grass given to a bull which is left free to roam about as the god's animal, does not give us
any fruit; or respect given to a man who is completely thankless and does not give us anything in
return;
(282) Similarly, without any sense that we are the givers and the recipient is being obliged by us, we
should give with a clear understanding that nothing in return is going to come back to us.
(283) O the brave Arjuna, when anything is given with all these good things and conditions
prevailing, it should be considered the best charity among all.
(284) And the right place, the right time, the deserving Brahmin,- when all these are together, that
giving, that charity becomes flawless and pure.
य ु प युपकाराथ फलमुि य वा पुनः|
दीयते च प रि ल ं त ानं राजसं मृतम्
But, with an expectation of returns or receiving some fruit in exchange, if the charity is given with
much anguish in our mind, that charity is called Rajasic (21)
(285) But just as a cow is fed with a motive that it will give milk or seeds are sown in a field with
the aim of filling the godown with grains,
(286) Or just as with an eye on the receiving of a good present, a relative is invited to attend some
ceremony or to send some present to the home of an austere householder knowing that he will
surely give something in return.
(287) Or just as a man first pockets the payment offered for a job and then starts doing it or as a
doctor first gets the payment for medicine and then gives that medicine to a patient,
(288) Or as some charity is given or donation is given with a motive that one may go on taking
benefit from that man in future in lieu of that donation,
(289) Or when by chance a Brahmin meets us on the road, who is surely not able to give back
anything.
(290) One cunningly gives him a farthing and in return squeezes out from him a declaration that in
that paltry fee, one's all ancestral and family sins are abated!
