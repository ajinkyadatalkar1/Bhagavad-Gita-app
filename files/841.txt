This verse refers to the great feat of Krishna, who created by his
divine power all the cows and calves, duplicating the whole cattle which
was stolen by Lord Brahma to tease Krishna. This magic went on for
one year but nobody came to know that all the cattle was created by
Krishna. This defeated the Lord Brahma who surrendered the original
cattle to Krishna and begged for forgiveness.

Arjuna who was observing the rules of ascetic life, had visited
Dwarka, for some time during his travels and pilgrimages. There he saw
Subhadra the sister of Krishna and Balarama. He fell in love with her
and with the private consent of Krishna, kidnapped her in his chariot at
which time he defeated all warriors who opposed him. This Ovi refers to
the help which Krishna gave to Arjuna, even going to the length of
deceiving all.
(36) Chapter 11. Ovi - 35.
Krishna refers in this verse to the story of Ambareesha, a king of
renowned bravery, generosity and devotion to God. The Yogi Sage
Durwasa one day came to him at the time of the latter's time of ending of
the fast of Ekadashi on the following day; and told him to await him till
he (the sage) would return after taking a bath in the river. The lunar day
of 12th Tithi was about to come to an end shortly and by the ritualistic
discipline it was necessary for the king to take food before the Moon
passed on to 13th day. Now, the king waited and waited but Durwasa
was not seen. In order not to miss the religious merit the king took only
sacred Teertha of the Pooja and completed his observance of the fast etc.
Durwasa came some moments later and admonished him for taking food
before the guest and cursed him that he would be born in all sorts of
categories of beings like fish, turtle, etc. for ten times. Ambareesh
