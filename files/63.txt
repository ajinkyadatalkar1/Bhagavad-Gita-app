(160) Or, just as there is rising and setting of Sun etc., going on in Nature, this chain of birth and
death is also inevitable.
(161) At the time of total deluge, all this trinity of worlds is also annihilated; so, this beginning and
ending is going on unbroken.
(162) When you know this, why are you grieving, O, the great archer! You are feigning ignorance
though you know it.
(163) There is something else. If you think about this from various angles, you have no reason to
lament about anything.
अ य ादीिन भूतािन य म यािन भारत|
अ य िनधना येव तत का प रदेवना
O Bharat! Before birth, the beings are unmanifest. They are manifest in the middle stage and after
death also they become unmanifest. What occasion is there for grieving then? (28)
(164) These beings were without form before their birth and when born, they became visible.
(165) There is no doubt that when they will be dead, they will not become some other beings; they
will only go back to their former state.
(166) But what becomes apparent in the middle is like a dream to a man who is sleeping. This shape
of theirs is appearing on the Reality, due to Maya.
(167) Water which is being moved by the wind appears wave-like; and gold appears to be an
ornament by the design made by the goldsmith.
(168) Similarly, all this which has ‘form’ should be understood as the doing of Maya, like clouds
which seem to be attached to the sky.
(169) So, why are you grieving for that which is not existing originally? Know surely that the spirit
does not become distorted at all.
(170) When there is great love for this spirit, in the hearts of the saints, the lust and desire
themselves leave them and seeking this spirit, the ascetics resort to deep forest.
(171) Keeping spirit as the aim in their view, great sages undertake penances and vows of celibacy,
etc.
