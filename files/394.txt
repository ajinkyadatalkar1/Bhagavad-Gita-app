(138) When all our interests are engrossed in meditation, all the actions keep themselves aloof from
us.
(139) When action is far removed in this manner, the giving up of fruit happens automatically, and by
that giving up, there is undisturbed peace.
(140) O, the husband of Subhadra, this is the path of steps towards attainment of peace, and therefore
it is necessary to undertake constant study from the beginning.
शेयो िह ानम यासा ानाद् यानं िविश यते|
याना कमफल याग यागा छाि तरन तरम्
Knowledge is superior to study, and meditation is superior to knowledge; but giving up of fruits
of action is still of a higher grade, and attaining peace is the highest state. (12)
(141) Dear Partha, knowledge is deeper than study, and meditation is still better than knowledge.
(142) Then giving up of the fruit of action is still better than meditation, and the enjoyment of the
happiness of peace is superior to it.
(143) O the great warrior, such is the way of various steps by which gradually the goal of peace is
reached.
अ े ा सवभूतानां मैतः क ण एव च|
िनममो िनरहंकारः समदुःखसुखः मी
My devotee has no enmity towards all the beings. He has friendliness. He is compassionate. He
has no sense of possession. He has no ego. He considers pain and pleasure with a sense of
equanimity. He is of a forgiving nature. (13)
(144) (My devotee is such that) He does not know any feeling of dislike towards all the beings, and
just as the spirit has no discrimination between anybody intimate or otherwise, he has similarly
no partiality towards anybody.
(145) Just like the earth, he does not hold on intimately to the best person or avoid a person of lower
rank.
(146) The life force, or breath which is kind-hearted, does not differentiate, or say that "I will
maintain the movement of the body of a king, and leave aside the poor man" (similarly this
devotee is equal to all.)
(147) He is just like water, which quenches the thirst of a cow and does not become a poison and
kill a tiger.
