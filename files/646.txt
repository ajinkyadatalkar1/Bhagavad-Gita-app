(402) That supreme state is alone, unbroken pure absolute Brahman and this word, this name is
indicative of its inner power.
(403) Just as sky itself is the support for the sky, this name has the support of this name only.
(404) The Sun which rises in the sky illumined by himself and not by any other. Similarly this name
itself is the manifest Brahman.
य े तपिस दाने च ि थितः सिदित चो यते|
कम चैव तदथ यं सिद येवािभधीयते
And the firm steady faith in the performance of sacifices, penances and charity is likewise spoken
of as 'SAT' and acion for the sake of God is also called as 'SAT' only. (27)
(405) This name should not be simply taken to be of three letters, but should be considered as
Brahman. Thus, whatever is done for this purpose;
(406) Whatever it be as sacrifice, charity or penance and may it be finalized or remain incomplete -
(407) All of these become one with Brahman, just as by the touch of 'Parees', gold is always made
pure, there is no gold of lesser mark.
(408) Just as rivers once merged into sea cannot be separately recognized, similarly in this action
which is surrendered into Brahman there is no defect whatsoever.
(409) Thus, O the wise Arjuna, I have explained to you the power and the nature of this name of
Brahman-
(410) And, O the brave warrior, I have also told you the hidden significance of each term contained
in it.
(411) Such is the significance of this name which indicates Brahman. My dear, have you now
understood its importance?
(412) Now, therefore, let your faith in this name be enhanced from today– the name which
immediately destroys all bondage.
(413) When in any action this word 'Sat' is used, it will be tantamount to the performance of Veda
recitation with all its facets.
