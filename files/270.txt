(340) I do everything for them who worship me with their Life just as the mother knows what a small
child, which does not know its hunger or thirst, needs and does it.
(341) If they wish to be united with me I give them that, and if they feel happy in doing service to me,
I give them that opportunity, through Love.
(342) Thus whatever desire they hold in their mind, I go on supplying those things to them, and
maintain them.
(343) O Pandava, it is my job to give them everything they need, when they have only me as their
only refuge in all respects.
येऽ य यदेवताभ ा यज ते श याऽि वताः|
तेऽिप मामेव कौ तेय यज यिविधपूवकम्
Those who are devotees of other deities worshipping them faithfully, really worship me only; but
O, Kounteya, that worship is not proper according to the science of devotion. (23)
(344) There are also some devotees but they do not know me comprehensively. They are those who
worship such gods as the fire, Indra, sun, and moon, etc.
(345) That devotion is also for me only, because I am all these gods, but that devotion is not proper,
it is indirect and astray.
