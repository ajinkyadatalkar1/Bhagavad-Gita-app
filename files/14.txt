that the mark of that hitting appeared on the back of Dnyandeva. The
people were surprised. A senior Pandit asked - ''Do you think that even
this male buffalo can recite the Vedas as we Brahmins do?'' Dnyandeva
said ''Yes''. In order to prove this, he simply put his benedictory palm on

After completion of this commentary, he wrote another book by name
Amrutanubhava, which means in general, the experiencing of
