(311) Even for these for whom, the practice of controlling is very regular and who are always very
strictly controlling their minds-
(312) This task is very tiresome. The power of these senses is so great. It is like a ghost
overpowering the Mantrik - the exorcist.
(313) The objects of enjoyments first appear in the form of occult powers and prosperity of various
kinds, but they catch hold of the seeker by contact with his sense-organs.
(314) When the mind is turned towards them at the time of that contact, its control becomes slack.
Such is the strength of sense-organs.
तािन सवािण संय य यु आसीत म परः|
वशे िह य येि दयािण त य प ा पिति ता
Therefore, having controlled them all, and collecting one’s mind, one should remain still,
devoting oneself to me. For, one whose senses are subdued, is known to be a man with stable
intellect. (61)
(315) Therefore, having dropped interest in all the objects, one who subdues his senses, altogether,
(316) is the man entitled for the state of real faith in yoga, whose mind does not fall a prey to the lust
for objects - which fact you should know thoroughly.
(317) He always remains steadfast in his self-knowledge and he never forgets me in his heart.
(318) If, in fact no outer objects are actually in contact, but inwardly there is thinking of the objects,
the worldly life and attachment are quite fully active in the case of such a person.
(319) Just as a drop of poison becomes strong enough to kill a man,
(320) similarly even if a little doubtful attachment to objects held in the mind is still there, it
destroys all the activities of discrimination.
यायतो िवषया पुंसः संग तेषूपजायते|
संगा संजायते कामः कामा कोधोऽिभजायते
कोधा वित संमोहः संमोहात् मृितिवभमः|
मृितभंशाद् बुि नाशो बुि नाशात् पण यित
The man thinking of sense-objects develops attachment for them; from attachment, the desire for
them arises and (if desire is not fulfilled) from desire, disturbance and anger arise. (62)
