(107) Or the waves on the sea spread only within the limits of the shores. Similarly the non - dual
Brahman itself assumes the form of this worldly life.
(108) For examples, in dream we ourselves project various people though we are only one
individual. Similarly the whole expanse and shape of the apparent tree of this worldly life is the
'Brahman' only.
(109) But let us stop here. In short, this strange and wonderful tree comes into existence and because
it has various sprouts like 'Mahat' etc., its branches grow further on the lower levels.
(110) Now I shall tell you, why the men of knowledge give this tree the name of Ashwattha.
(111) The letter shwah ( à¤ƒ)means the next dawn or the day of tomorrow and
this tree has no endurance even up to the next day.
(112) Every moment the colours of cloud undergo many changes and
the lightning does not remain steady even for the moment of batting
of the eye.
(113) Or the trembling lotus-leaf cannot remain steady on the surface of
water or the mind of a man who is suffering from something is never
peaceful.
(114) Similar is the case of this tree of worldly life. It is being
destroyed every moment and therefore it is called 'Ashwattha.'
(115) Some say that the meaning of the term Ashwattha is the common
'peepul' tree, but the lord Shri Krishna is not referring to it here.
(116) But suppose we take that meaning, then also we can understand
the imagery with proper sequence. But let us put it aside. What
concern have we with common-place things?
(117) Therefore, O listeners, please listen to the original text being
explained, which is quite out of the ordinary. Thus this tree should
be called Ashwattha because it is impermanent.
