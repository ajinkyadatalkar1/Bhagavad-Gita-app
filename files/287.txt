worship done by good men, who have real faith in their hearts; you
are like a lion, who breaks and smashes the head of the elephant
called the worldly life. You are the place of the origin of the
universe, O, my great Guru!
(6) Your blessing is virtually the God Ganesha himself. When that
blessing is given, even a child can get introduction into the secrets of
ever-great literature.
(7) When the Guru's benevolent blessing is received, saying, "Do not
fear", it is possible to go deeper into the sea of all the nine literary
moods, and reach the final mastery of expression.
(8) If your loving speech caresses a mute person, he will challenge even
the Guru of Gods in the matter of writing a literary epic!
(9) Let if be as it is. Even if your glance dazzles upon anybody or your
lotuslike palm touches anybody's head with kindness, that person,
though only a Jeeva, will be equal to Shiva (Mahesha).
(10) How can I describe and with what words, the greatness which is
capable of doing such things? Can one apply scented paste to the
Sun?
(11) How much more flowers can we put on the divine wish-tree? With
what lavish foods can the ocean of milk be felicitated? With what
scent can the camphor be honoured?
(12) What material can be used to apply paste to the sandalwood? How
can we cook nectar? How can the sky's height be raised further?
(13) Similarly, knowing that there is hardly any means to understand
the greatness of my Sadguru, I quietly saluted him and stopped.
