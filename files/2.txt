Critics are requested to go into the spirit of teachings rather than the
accuracy or otherwise of the terms used by the translator, which are
wont to give a broad margin for differences of interpretations and
opinions. The variation occurs in these matters according to the
emphasis one puts on the particular view or angle of the poetry as
understood by him.
While translating into prose form, the serial numbers of the verses
which are usually given at the end of each verse, are put by me at the
beginning of each verse, and unlike the running text in many Marathi
editions of Dnyaneshwari, I have made a separate para for each verse,
making the text easier for reading and grasping its meaning.
For reference, I have selected the Marathi book of Shri Dnyaneshwari,
published by the same publishers, which contains the meaning given by
late Shri B. A. Bhide, a veteran scholar of the last century. While giving
the meaning in English, however, I have followed my own
interpretations, sometimes referring to the book - by Shri R. N.
Welingkar, which is the dictionary of obsolete words used in
Dnyaneshwari with their meaning in the current Marathi language. In
addition I have referred to books on Dnyaneshari by Late Shri Sakhare
Maharaj and late Prof. S. V. Dandekar - both the most popular books.
At the beginning of the book, I have given a prose version of Sanskrit
verses giving the gist of the praise of the Lord Shri Krishna and of the
Geeta, with a separate chapter giving the dialogue between the Earth and
the Lord Vishnu, about the glory and greatness of the Geeta.
As appendix, I have given in short the stories and episodes which are
referred to by Saint Dnyaneshwar in his Commentary, at various places
in the text, so that readers who are not acquainted with the background
stories may have some idea about the examples given by Saint
Dnyaneshwar.
