(55) I cannot know what is better for us even after deep thinking because my mind is overwhelmed
by affection.
(56) As our eyesight becomes so dim due to disease, that we cannot see the objects which are very
near to us.
(57) O God, so is my condition, because this my mind is caught in the whirlpool of confusion and I
do not even know in what action lies our true welfare.
(58) Therefore, O Krishna, you may please know it and tell me what is true in this, because you are
our friend and you are everything to us.
(59) You are the teacher, the brother, the father, you are the deity dear to us; and you are always our
protector.
(60) The teacher does not refuse anything for the disciple and the sea does not refuse to accept the
rivers.
(61) O Krishna, please listen. If a mother leaves her child and goes away, how can the child live?
(62) Similarly, you alone are everything to us, and now if you do not agree with what I said just
now,
(63) Then what is good for us, in which there will not be any deviation from our Duty? O, the
Greatest Human Being, please tell me that now!
न िह पप यािम ममापनु ात्|
य छोकमु छोषणिमंिदयाणाम्
अवा य भूमावसप नमृ म्|
रा यं सुराणामिप चािधप यम्
For, even if we gain undisputed and rich kingdom on this Earth, and the leadership of the gods, I
do not see any means which will drive away the grief which is drying up my senses. (8)
(64) This grief which has arisen in my mind at the sight of all these relatives and kinsmen, will not
be removed by anything else than your advice.
(65) Even this earth may be under our power, or I may even attain the throne of Mahendra, the king
of gods; but this confusion in my mind will not subside.
(66) If seeds which are scorched by fire are sown in a fertile field, they will not sprout even if
ample water is sprinkled in the field.
