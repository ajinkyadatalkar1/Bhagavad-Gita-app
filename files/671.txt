पर यो सादनाथ वा त ामसमुदा तम्
The penance which is performed involving suffering to oneself, with adamant foolish
determination or with a motive to oust others is called Tamas penance. (19)
(254) O the great archer, when by being obsessed by stupidity our body is considered as our enemy..
(255) And that body is subjected to five types of fire, and such articles are eaten which produce
burning like fire inside the body,.
(256) They burn insense on their head, prick and poke their back with sharp hooks or they sit in a
circle of fire and scorch their body.
(257) By withholding breath they punish themselves and observe severe fast without reason and get
themselves hung with their heads down and breathe smoke from burning artcles below on the
ground!
(258) They sit in extreme cold water upto their neck on the rocky banks of river or cut pieces of their
own living flesh.
(259) O Dhananjaya, when the penance is performed by subjecting the body to various kinds of
suffering, its main purpose is to create a mischief for others and destroy them.
(260) Just as a big boulder on the slope of a hill escapes from its hold by its own weight and falls
downwards, being itself shattered to pieces, and crushing anything that happens to be in its way.
(261) The Tamasic man performs this type of penance, himself harassing his own life- element and
by destroying them, for his own victory.
(262) O the crowned one, in short, the penance of this type, resulting in suffering should be known as
Tamasic penance.
(263) Thus, I have shown you clearly how there are three types of penances according to the three
qualities of Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas.
(264) Now, as a natural sequence, I will tell you the three types of "charities."
(265) The charity is also having triple divisions according to the qualities. Please listen to the
Sattwic charity first.
