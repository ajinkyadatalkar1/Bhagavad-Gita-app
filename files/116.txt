(42) But you do not know that there have been many births of both of us, but you are not remembering
your former births.
(43) O the great archer! I do remember all the details of when and in what forms I came here.
अजोऽिप स न यया मा भूतानामी रोऽिप सन्|
पक

Though birthless and deathless and the Lord of all beings, I manifest myself through my own
divine power (Prakriti), by utilising it as the base thereof! (6)
(44) Therefore, I remember all the past lives and though I am birthless, I become manifest by being
associated with my Prakriti.
(45) My eternal indestructible nature is not disturbed but I appear to come and go which is the
reflection in the Maya, of my own nature.
(46) My state of freedom is not destroyed but appear to be subjected to the effects of Karma, but that
also appears because of deluded intellect, not otherwise.
(47) When one thing appears to be duplicated it is only because of the mirror. Is there a second
thing, if we think clearly?
(48) So, O, the wielder of beautiful crown, I am abstract but when I make use of my nature or
Prakriti, I become enformed as if an actor playing a role in a drama.

अ यु थानमधम य तदा मानं सृजा यहम्
O Bharata, whenever the religion is on the decline and irreligiousness is on the increase, then I
become manifest. (7)
(49) It is the tradition from the beginning of time that in every age I myself have to protect religion in
all respects.
(50) Therefore, I leave aside my nature of having no birth, and I do not even remember that I am
unmanifest, when this irreligiousness overpowers the religion.
