in the light of a lamp.
(178) Or just as when the Sun rises, we can see our way clearly; similarly, by carefully seeing
clearly what are the directions of Vedas and the scriptures–
(179) And by collecting all the utensils and articles useful for the sacifice, and arranging them
properly, as if placed by the god, the creator, himself for the sacrifice;
(180) And if all the articles are properly placed in their respective places, just as ornaments
properly used for each limb of the body,
(181) What more should I describe? Then the very Goddess of sacrifice, ornamented, seems to have
become manifest in the form of sacrificial ritual.
(182) So, when the sacrifice is so accomplished in all respects in which there is no iota of selfish
desire for any self-importance.
(183) And just like a Tulsi plant though given water by a small water source does not give flowers,
fruit or even a shade.
(184) Or in short, when the sacrifice is so performed without attachment or hope for its fruit, that
sacrifice should be considered as of Sattwic quality.
अिभसंधाय तु फलं द भाथमिप चैव यत्|
इ यते भरतशे तं य ं िवि राजसम्
O the great among Bharatas! When the sacrifice is performed with an eye towards its fruit, or
with hypocrisy, just to boast about it, know it to be Rajasic. (12)
(185) O the great warrior! Now if a sacrifice is done in the same maner as described above, but it is
having a hidden selfish end, just like when a king is invited to attend somebody's ancestral rites,
(186) The inviters think that if the king attends, much help it would be for them, they will be famous
and there will not be any shortage of funds for the rites.
(187) Similarly, when there is a desire to attain the whole heaven, and the performer hopes to be
very famous by the sacrifice,
(188) O Partha, when the sacrifice is performed only to get its fruit and to boast about it and is to get
social importance then that sacrifice is of Rajas quality.
