understand it.
(19) Just let it be like giving of a specific remedy to cure the disease and that medicine should also
be tasty and sweet.
(20) Let your talk be full of all the meaning but it should be such as I can understand.
(21) My Lord, when we have a real precepter like you, why should we hesitate to satisfy our
curiosity? You are really like our mother. So, of whom should I be shy?
(22) If the Divine Cow is in someone’s possession, who will deter from expressing his real desire?
(23) If the wish-stone (Chintamani) is in our hand, what difficulty is there in wishing anything? Why
should we stop from desiring what we want?
(24) If we reach the ocean of nectar and die of thirst at the shore, why at all should we make all the
efforts earlier to reach there?
(25) Similarly, if after long penance to propitiate the husband of Goddess Laxmi in the past birth,
you are here near us, -
(26) why should we not request you the Almighty, with all our ferver? O Lord, this is really the
dawn of good times for us, I think!
(27) Please see. All my aspirations are rejuvenated and all my merit has reached the zenith of
success, and my desires have become fulfilled.
(28) O the greatest of all gods, O the home of all auspicious things! It is by that merit that you are so
kindly belonging to us, today.
(29) For a mother, there is no wrong time for a child to be breast-fed,
(30) Similarly, O Lord, I am asking you, through my anxiety according to my desire, you who are the
treasure of blessings.
(31) So, please tell that definitely which will be beneficial in the higher worlds and will also be
appropriated in the present situation here.” - So said Partha.
