(258) Similarly when the soul leaves the body at the time of death by packing his desires in the
bundle of Tamas, he enters another body which has the same qualities of Tamas.
(259) But it is not necessary to explain these things further. When the man dies in the condition of
Tamas, he is born either as a beast or a bird or a tree or an insect.
कमणः सुक
ृ त याहः साि वक
ं िनमलं फलम्|
रजस तु फलं दुःखम ानं तमसः फलम्
The result of good deed is said to be Sattwic and clean; The result of Rajas is pain and sorrow
and the result of Tamas is ignorance. (16)
(260) Thus, in other words, that which is born out of Sattwa quality is good Karma or meritorious
Karma in the opinion of all the Vedas.
(261) Therefore, that fruit or result which is consisting of happiness and knowledge is called the
Sattwic result which is produced by the blotless pious actions.
(262) The actions of Rajas should be supposed to be as bitter gourd because their results appear to
be good and comfortable, but bitter and painful as that gourd.
(263) Or just as the ripe neem fruit appears good but is bitter inside, so is the result of Rajasic
actions.
(264) Ignorance is the fruit of all the Tamasic actions, just as a poisonous tree bears poisonous fruit.
स वा संजायते ानं रजसो लोभ एव च|
पमादमोहौ तमसो भवतोऽ ानमेव च
By Sattwa, knowledge is born, while by Rajas greed is born. By Tamas the committing of
mistakes, confusion and ignorance are born (17)
(265) Therefore, O Arjuna, just as the Sun is the maker of the day, so Sattwa quality is the cause of
self- knowledge and -
(266) As the forgetfulness about our own reality produces duality; so the Rajas creates greed.
(267) And O the learned Arjuna, the quality of Tamas is the cause of the group of bad qualities of
confusion, ignorance and committing of mistakes.
(268) I have explained to you the different signs of these qualities as clearly perceptible to your
intellect as the small fruit of emblica on the open palm.
