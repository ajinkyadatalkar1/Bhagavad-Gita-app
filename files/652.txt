scriptures and have the fruit of unanimous opinion?
(27) All right! Suppose we finally decide what is right action in this

(28) And how can all men get lucky enough to have co-ordination of
the scriptures, their meaning, enough money, right place, and right

(29) It seems very difficult to do any action exactly according to the
rules. Then where is the scope for ordinary men, who seek liberation,
to do anything?"
(30) Arjuna desires to ask this question and that is the subject of the
seventeenth chapter.
(31) Arjuna was very disinterested in ordinary enjoyments of life; was

(33) He was the beloved of the 'lady intelligence', the maternal home of
spiritual wisdom and the constantly accompanying consciousness of
Lord Krishna.
