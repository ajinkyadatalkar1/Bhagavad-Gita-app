Now if at all you do not fight this religious battle, you will lose your duty, your fame and earn sin
instead. (33)
(196) Now if you try to avoid this battle, and lament for false things, then you will yourself become
loser of yourself.
(197) If you drop your weapon in this battle, it will be like your being the destroyer of whatever
merit your forefathers had earned.
(198) The existing fame will be lost, the world will curse you and great stigmas will come searching
for you.
(199) Just as a woman becomes insulted or looked down upon when she becomes a widow, the
plight of your life will be similar if you do not perform your ordained duty.
(200) Or your condition will be so detestable by great blemishes, that it will be like that of a corpse
in the battleground which is eaten from all sides by vultures.
अक ित चािप भूतािन कथिय यि त तेऽ ययाम्|
संभािवत य चाक ितमरणादित र यते
And, all people will tell at large your infamy endlessly. Really, death is preferable to infamy to a
noble man, because infamy is more painful. (34)
(201) Therefore, if you negligently miss this performance of your own duty, you will become a prey
to sin and your infamy will not subside for eternity.
(202) A wise man should live only so long as the blemish, the infamy does not touch him.
Furthermore, tell me how you can get away from here.
(203) You may very well withdraw from the battle because you have no jealousy and are full of pity,
but these warriors will not appreciate that action.
(204) They will surround you from all sides, and throw their arrows at you. O Arjuna, you cannot
then escape by virtue of your personal feelings of pity.
(205) And even if at the risk of your life, you will escape from this battle, that living will be worse
than actual death for you.
(206) One more thing you are not considering. You have proudly come here for fighting. And if you
turn back thus having a pang of pity-
(207) Will your so doing be properly understood by all these your enemies? O Arjuna, tell me.
