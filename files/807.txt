(1549) By asking this question, the Lord brought Arjuna back to the awareness that he was Arjuna,
(though unreal in the spiritual sense) and made him say - "I AM COMPLETE'- which was his
experience.
(1550) Then just as the Moon rising out of the white ocean of milk, when shining in the sky, seems
white and brilliant most naturally without any effort.
(1551) Similarly Arjuna stood as a separate person but he was one moment forgetting that he was
Brahman, and he immediately experienced that the whole world was impregrated by Brahman,
and when he felt like going beyond that feeling, the Brahman-consciousness also disappeared.
(1552) Thus having and not having the feeling that he was Brahman, alternately, Arjuna was
confused and stood motionless on the verge of being very unhappy in the state of being Arjuna, the
person.
(1553) Then with unsteady hands he smoothed his uncontrolled hair, and somehow becoming free of
sweat.
(1554) Steadying his body himself by controlling its undulations caused by irregular breathing and
preventing his body's unsteady gait,
(1555, 1556) Withholding the joyous tears behind his eyelids and subduing
the emotions which were contracting his throat, and making them subside inwards.
(1557) By re-establishing proper articulation of words by the tongue and controlling his shallow and
irregular breathing.
अजुन उवाच-
न ो मोहः मृितल धा व पसादा मयाऽ युत|
ि थतोऽि म गतस देहः क र ये वचनं तव
Arjuna said, "Gone is the confusion. Memory has come back, O Achuta, by your blessing! I am
now steady and ready, with my doubt totally gone! I will abide by your teaching! (73)
(1558) Then Arjuna said- "O my Lord, why do you ask whether I am still confused? Sir! The
confusion has already left me, together with its followers!
(1559) Is it necessary in any town that the Sun should come very near a man and ask whether he is
seeing darkness anywhere?
(1560) Similarly is it an ordinary thing that we can see you actually by our eyes near us? Is that not
enough?
