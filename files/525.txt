is beyond all senses.-
(17) That fortune it is possible for the speech to enjoy by being lucky
enough to get the touch of the particles of dust from the feet of the
Guru.
(18) What more can be said? I, Dnyanadeva, clearly declare that no
other love except the mother's love can equal the Guru's love.
(19) Because I am like an innocent child and my Guru is a mother
having only one child, his love flows singularly to me only.
(20) Dear listeners, please see how the cloud pours all the riches of its
waters only for quenching the thirst of the bird Chataka. Similarly my
Guru has showered me with his compassion.
(21) Therefore, my empty mouth having nothing else to do, started
casually uttering some words, and miraculously the great wisdom
began to be expressed sweetly in them.
(22) When one is lucky, even the dust turns into a gem, and when the
time of death has not come, a man who comes to kill, begins to love.
(23) If the Lord of the world takes up on himself to provide good food
at the time of dinner of his devotee, even the pebbles put in hot water
to boil, will turn into rice as sweet as nectar.
(24) Similarly when the Guru kindly accepts disciple in his grace, even
his ordinary worldly life becomes a saga of liberation.
(25) Just see! Had the Lord Shrikrishna who is the eternal, the most
ancient Narayana, worshipped by all the world, allowed Pandavas to
feel any lacuna in their life?
