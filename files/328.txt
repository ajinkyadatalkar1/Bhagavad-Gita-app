(80) Therefore, we cannot feel inhibition while asking you. Whatever comes up in our mind, we
should speak out before you!"
On this, the Lord said, "Enough, enough! Tell me what you want to know."
एवमेत था थ वमा मानं परमे र|
द िम छािम ते पमै रं पु षो म
O the Great God, O the supreme person! I wish to see your divine form as you have described
yourself so far. (3)
(81) Then Arjuna said- "My Lord, I have the satisfaction of grasping what you have talked about and
my intellect has become peaceful.
(82) Now, that, by whose Will all this process of the worlds comes into existence and comes to an
end, and which state you call as your own reality;
(83) That real nature of yours from which you come in the world for the purpose of helping gods, by
assuming forms either having two arms or four, etc.
(84) The state where your qualified form returns after the play of incarnations in the categories of
life as the fish, the tortoise etc.; involving also sleeping in the ocean.
(85) That which the Upanishads sing about, that which yogis see by withdrawing within their hearts
and that which the sages like Sanaka, lovingly embrace,
(86) That which is your universal form about which I have so far heard by my ears, is the Form to
see which, O God, my mind is very eager.
(87) My Lord, you have so far relieved me of all my worries and fulfilled every wish of mine. Now
only one fanciful wish is remaining in my mind.
(88) I have been hoping from the bottom of my heart, to see by my eyes your total Universal form.
म यसे यिद त छ यं मया द िमित पभो|
योगे र ततो मे वं दशया मानम ययम्
O Yogeshwara! O my Lord, if you think that it is possible for me to see that Form, please show
me yourself as imperishable as you are. (4)
(89) O the wielder of Sharnga bow; there is one thing more. Am I eligible to see that universal form
of yours?
