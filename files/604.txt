wood, and seas of boiling oil.
(374) Where there is a continuous chain of sufferings and an ever new harassment and torture by the
king of Death, which place is called the hell.
(375) Even when they suffer the cruelest punishment in hell; when they take next birth, they are seen
again performing evil sacrifices in their confused state of mind.
(376) O Dhananjaya, really the various performances of sacrifices are misused by them with great
hypocrisy and are made useless by them.
आ मसंभािवताः त धा धनमानमदाि वताः|
यज ते नामय ै ते द भेनािविधपूवकम्
They are puffed up by the possession of money and social status, are self-righteous and hard as
pillars, and by deceptive intentions, they perform hypocritically, the sacrifices without following the
proper procedure, which are only name-sake rituals. (17)
(377) Just as a bad woman though only a keep of a certain man, shows off like a legally married
wife,
(378) Similarly, by thinking themselves to be very important persons, they become sullen by their
conceit.
(379) Then, like steel pillars, or a cliff rising high in the sky they do not bend at all.
(380) They are so filled with self-esteem that they consider the whole world more insignificant than
even a blade of grass.
(381) Further, O the great archer! They are so swollen - headed by the money they possess that they
do not care at all about what is good action and what is pohibited.
(382) How can such people who are so proud, ever perform proper sacrifices? But there is no
saying what these mad people will do!
(383) So, in a fit they decide to show off by performing the outward details of the sacrificial rituals
to deceive others.
(384) But, there is no proper sacrificial pit, nor the canopy or the place of putting idol of various
gods, called Vedi and there is no question of proper discipline nor collection of necessary
utensils.
(385) They do not tolerate even the casual hearing of the names of Brahmins or the gods! Then who
would attend their ceremonies?
