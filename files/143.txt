separateness any scope in the three worlds? Then this man sees the whole world in his Atman, in
its free state, by his inner realization.
(86) This is like the happening at sunrise. At sunrise there is the festival of lights in the east; but
there is no darkness in other directions also at the same time.
त ु य तदा मान ति न ा त परायणाः|
ग छ यपुनरावृि ं ानिनधूतक मषाः
Those whose mind and intellect are wholly merged in Brahman, who remain constantly
established in identity with Brahman, and have finally become one with Brahman, their sins being
wiped out by wisdom, reach the state whence there is no return. (17)
(87) When the intellect is firm and by self-realization there is conviction that he is Brahman and
there is total identification continuously with that Brahman.
(88) He should be called having equilibrium of vision because of the knowledge of omnipresence.
Brahman is fully developed in his heart. What further should I tell?
(89) What wonder is it if I say that such men know the whole universe as their Atman?
(90) But fortune itself can never, even for entertainment, see the misery; and the discrimination
cannot recognize the delusion.
(91) Or the Sun cannot see the sample of darkness even in dream or the word ‘death’ is never heard
by nectar.
(92) Or the Moon never remembers heat. Similarly the men of wisdom, having self-knowledge can
never see any separateness in all the beings.
िव ािवनयसंप ने बा णे गिव हि तिन|
शुिन चैव पाक
े च पि डताः समदिशनः
The men of wisdom look with equanimity upon all beings, a Brahmin who is learned and humble
or may be a cow, an elephant, a dog and a person belonging to a caste in which dog’s flesh is also
eaten. (18)
(93) Then where is the difference in considering a mosquito or an elephant or a man of low caste or
a Brahmin or somebody as our near relative or a stranger?
(94) Similarly to differentiate between a cow and a dog or someone great or lowly is just like a
dream to a person who is awake in the unity of all.
