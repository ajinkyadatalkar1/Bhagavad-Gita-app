in it.
(411) Such is the significance of this name which indicates Brahman. My dear, have you now
understood its importance?
(412) Now, therefore, let your faith in this name be enhanced from today– the name which
immediately destroys all bondage.
(413) When in any action this word 'Sat' is used, it will be tantamount to the performance of Veda

(421) Similarly by doing any actions like this we will not get any enjoyments in this world nor can
we expect anything pleasurable in the other world.
(422) Therefore, if we do anything without faith in Brahman, that is simply an unnecessary trouble,
