(234) Among the inert masses like mountains, I am Himalaya the great holder of ‘‘spiritual merit’’ -

Among all the trees I am Ashwattha, and Narada among the celestial sages, Chitraratha of the
Angels of music, and Muni Kapila among the Adepts of occultism, among the horses I am
Uchchaishrawa, who was born from the ocean, and know me as the sea of milk out of which gods got
the nectar. Amongst the great elephants I am Gajendra and I am the King of the human beings.

all the famous speedy beings I am Ucchhaishrawa.

which gods churned nectar.

his subjects.
