(833) By taking all the tendencies of all the senses with her, the intellect like a devoted wife,
embraces the husband which is the Atman, in the most sacred state;
(834) This state of intellect which is peace itself should be called "Peace" or "Shama" and when
action begins from this background,
(835) And when the quality of discipline controls the wild outer active organs by using the cudgel of
orders of scriptures and does not let them run amuck towards irreligious activities,
(836) It is called DAMA or the control of senses which helps the Shama in the right actions, and by
which all the activities are done well within the observance of ordained duties,

(844) And the gardener continuously works hard for watering a tree at its roots,
but knows that by way of sweet fruits, the hard work is going to be rewarded afterwards.
(845) Similarly knowledge, which makes a man aware that the only aim of performing his duties
according to the dictates of the scriptures is realization of god, is called the true knowledge or
spiritual wisdom.
(846) This is the seventh quality of such action and now see what is "Vidnyana" or worldly
