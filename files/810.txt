इ यहं वासुदेव य पाथ य च महा मनः|
संवादिमदमशौषम ुतं रोमहषणम्
Sanjay said- "Thus I have heard the exhilarating, wonderful dialogue of Wasudeva and the great
Partha." (74)
(1587) Sanjaya said, ‘‘What your nephew Arjuna said to the Lord Shrikrishna was liked by him very
much.
(1588) The names of the oceans as the eastern ocean and the western ocean are only different, but the
water in both is water only.
(1589) Similarly the duality of these two is only so far as their bodies are considered, but their
dialogue is the same.
(1590) This is like how when mirrors or even more reflective things are placed in front of each
other, both of them see themselves only, in the opposite mirrors.
(1591) Thus Arjuna was seeing in Krishna, his own as well as Shrikrishna's image and Shrikrishna
was also seeing Arjuna and himself in Arjuna.
(1592) The Lord was everywhere in both of them, whether in his own body or in Arjuna's body he
looked.
(1593) As there was nothing else, what did they do? They remained as one only.
(1594) Thus, if the two were not there but only one was existing, where was the possibility of
dialogue? How could conversation take place if duality was not there?
(1595) Thus, I have heard them talking by maintaining their duality, in which dialogue I was there,
dissolving into unity.
(1596) If two mirrors are cleansed and kept opposite facing each other, how can we imagine as to
which mirror is looking into which one?
(1597) Or, if a lighted lamp is kept opposite another lighted lamp, can we know whether one is
asking the other for a bit of light, and if so, which one is asking?
(1598) Or, if one Sun is kept opposite another Sun, can we decide who gives light and who is
lighted by whom?
(1599) If we go in for deciding, the decision is impossible. So, in this manner, the Lord Shrikrishna
and Arjuna were united by that dialogue.
