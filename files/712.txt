(303) The Lord Shrikrishna said- "Is it so? Then please listen with total attention to how I am going
to fulfil my promise.
(304) O the great Archer! It is true that all actions take place ‘‘out and out,’’ by the five causes,
without the knowledge of the Atman.
(305) And the reasons by which all the actions are done because of these factors,
are also variegated.
(306) The Atman is quite a different factor who is neither the purpose or reason nor the cause of
these actions.
(307) Just as day and night appear in the sky which is aloof, similarly good and bad actions are
taking place apparently on the Atman but unrelated to it.
(308) Water, heat and smoke are brought together by air; and clouds appear but the sky is not at all
aware or cognizant of them.
(309) A boat is made of wood. The boatman rows it and the air also helps to move it; but water is
there only as a witness.
(310) Or a potter takes in his hands a lump of clay, it is shaped as a pot which is moved by the pole
in the process, in which the potter's wheel also rotates.
(311) But the potter is the doer here. Does the earth has any job to do in this process except being the
base? Please think about this.
(312) Now, let this be! People go about their work of all kinds in the sunlight, but what job has the
Sun to do?
(313) Similarly when the five purposes are there, the five causes sow the creeper called by the name
"Action." But Atman is quite uninterested.
अिध ानं तथा कता करणं च पृथि वधम्|
िविवधा पृथ चे ा दैवं चैवात प चमम्
The place of actions, the doer of the actions, organs (or means or instruments) of different kinds,
and various movements of different types, and fifth is the divine plan. These five factors are operating
towards the accomplishment of actions in this world. (14)
(314) And now we will analyse and discuss these five as accurately as we purchase pearls by
carefully weighing them.
