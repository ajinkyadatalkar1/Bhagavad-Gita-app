that is the devotion, that is the worship to me.
(1179) So, O Kapidhwaja, he does act in the very non-action, because not to do anything as "Doer"
is my best worship.
(1180) And therefore, what he talks is my praise, whatever he looks at is looking at me and
whenever he walks, that is walking in the state of non-duality with me.
(1181) Whatever he does is my worship, whatever he conceives is Japa, repetition of my name, and
O Kapidhwaja, his very being is trance in my absoluteness.
(1182) This devotion of uniy with me is just like the unity of a bangle of gold with the gold.
(1183) As the wave is in the water, fragrance is in the camphor, and as the lustre in the jewel
remains without separation,
(1184) Or just as threads are in the cloth and earth is in the earthen pot, he and myself are in the unity
with each other.
(1185) O the wise one, by this undivided devotion to me, he sees me only as the Atman, the seer
himself, in each and everything.
(1186) Now, this universe is perceived as existing or non existing, in the three states of wakefulness,
dream and deep sleep by the dint of the duality of the "field"; and the knower of the field. (see
chapter 13)
(1187) O the good warrior, in the ecstacy of experiencing that he is all, he is the seer, he dances in
the bliss of self-realization.
(1188) Just as when a rope is verified as rope before our eyesight, we become certain that the
appearance of snake on the rope was really the rope only;
(1189) Just as when ornament is melted and only gold is in our hands, we come to realize that there
is not a single grain of ornament separate from gold;
(1190) Just as realizing that in the wave there is nothing except water only, we do not give value to
the shape of the wave;
(1191) Just as after awakening the man, knows that everything experienced in the dream is he himself
alone,
(1192) So, he knows that he is alone everything which is known to be or not to be, he enjoys in
himself the bliss of self realization.
