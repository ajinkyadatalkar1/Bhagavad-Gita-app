in the clouds, that cloud is not in the water.
(58) When by the disturbance of water in the clouds, there is bright lightning, can we say that the
lightning contains water?
(59) Tell me, though the smoke comes out of fire, is the fire in the smoke? Similarly I am not the
qualities though it appears that I am affected by them.
ितिभगुणमयैभावैरे िभः सविमदं जगत्|
मोिहतं नािभजानाित मामे यः परम ययम्
By these three qualities, the whole world is confused and therefore it does not know me to be
beyond these qualities and imperishable. (13)
(60) But there is moss on the water which covers it and there are clouds in the sky which hide the
sky.
(61) We can say that dream is false but so long as the sleep is prevailing, the dream seems to be
real. Do we remember ourselves at that time?
(62) Cataract is produced by water in the eye, but that cataract veils the eye-sight, is it not?
(63) Similarly this Maya of the three qualities is like my shadow but it has become a screen hiding
me.
(64) Therefore, all the beings do not recognise me. They are born out of me but do not become united
with me. Pearls which are created from water are not afterwards dissolved in it.
(65) Suppose we make an earthen pot. If we break it while it is wet, the clay mixes with the clay.
But if the earthen pot is baked, it becomes hard and it becomes different than the clay.
(66) Similarly all beings are like my limbs, but because of the power of Prakriti, they have become
Jeevas.
(67) Therefore, they are from me but they are not me. They are mine but they do not recognise me
because they have become blind by objects of senses due to ego, possessiveness and delusion.
दैवी ेषा गुणमयी मम माया दुर यया|
मामेव ये पप ते मायामेतां तरि त ते
My Prakriti which is divine and composed of the three qualities is very difficult to cross and go
beyond but only those who surrender themselves to me can go beyond it. (14)
