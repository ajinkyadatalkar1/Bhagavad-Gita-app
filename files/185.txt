The sinless yogi thus uniting his self constantly with Brahman, easily enjoys the great eternal bliss
of oneness with Brahman. (28)
(387) By this simple method, many have left back the so-called prosperity of thought projections and
got the realization of the state of freedom.
(388) The mind in its happiness has entered into Brahman. Just as the salt mixed with water cannot
separate itself from it.
(389) Similarly the mind in that unification, remains celebrating the festival of lights in the temple of
unity.
(390) It is thus necessary for us to walk back with our feet, towards our own Reality. But if you are
not capable of following this method also, please listen further.
सवभूत थमा मानं सवभूतािन चा मिन|
ई ते योगयु ा मा सवत समदशनः
यो मां प यित सवत सव च मिय प यित|
त याहं न पण यािम स च मे न पण यित
The yogi who is united with the allpervading, infinite consciousness, and sees only one-ness
everywhere, beholds the self present in all beings and all beings abiding in the self. (29)
(391) There is no doubt that I am in all the bodies and all the universe is within me.
(392) We should make efforts to understand by our intellect that the universe and ourselves are
mixed with each other in this manner.
(393) To tell the truth, O Arjuna, he who sees me equally in all the beings and worships me,
(394) And he whose mind does not see differences in all beings, only because they appear to be
different; and everywhere sees me alone.
(395) It is needless to say that he is one with me. Anyway eventhough I do not say so, O Arjuna, he
is myself only.
(396) Just as the lamp and its light are having a kind of unity between them, so he is in me and I am
in him.
(397) Just as juice is because of water; and space and sky are equal; so, that man has a form because
of my form.
