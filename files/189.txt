strength of the yoga.
(428) But we have had no inkling of what this yoga is and how it can be achieved, for so many days
upto now, and therefore, we say that this mind is uncontrollable.
(429) O! The Greatest Superman! It is now that this yoga is known to us by your grace!
अजुन उवाच-
अयितः श योपेतो योगा चिलतमानसः|
अपा य योगसंिसि ं कां गितं क
ृ ण ग छित
कि च नोभयिवभ ि छ नाभिमव न यित|
अपित ो महाबाहो िवमूढो ब णः पिथ
एत मे संशयं क
ृ ण छे ुमह यशेषतः|
वद यः संशय या य छे ा न ुपप ते
Arjuna said - “O Krishna, what becomes of the man who, though having faith, has not been able to
keep himself fixed in yoga practice, whose mind is diverted from yoga, and who thus fails to reach
perfection in yoga (upto the time of death)? (37)
Strayed from the path leading to self-realization and without firm footing in the study of yoga, is
he not, O krishna of big arms, lost like a shredded cloud, being deprived of both the self-realization
and heavenly pleasures? (38)
O Krishna, It behoves you to slash this doubt of mine completely; for, none other than you can be
found, who can cut this doubt. (39)
(430) But, O Master, there is one more doubt, and there is no one else to remove it.
(431) O Govinda, please satisfy my doubt. Suppose a man is trying to reach the state of liberation
with sincere faith, but has no knowledge of the systematic study of yoga.
(432) He has left behind the town of his sense-organs and begun to tread the path of faith to reach the
city of self-realization.
(433) What happened is that the self-realization is not achieved and coming back is also not
possible, and the sun of his life has set prematurely.
(434) Just as a cloud suddenly appearing out of season, neither gives rain nor retains its existence.
