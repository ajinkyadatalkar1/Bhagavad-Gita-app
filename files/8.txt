(16) He may attain the heaven of Moon where he will live for ten
thousand years and afterwards will be reborn as a human being only,
always continuing to read Geeta there also.
(17) He again will study Geeta and will attain the highest liberation and
even if a man utters the world ''Geeta'' at the moment of death, he will
have good progress in the higher worlds.
(18) If a man is having a great liking of listening to Geeta, he will
definitely attain Vaikuntha and will live in joy in the company of the
Lord Vishnu (Himself), even though he might have committed serious
sins in the past.
(19) He who does many duties in his daily life but always meditates on
the meaning of Geeta should be known as Jeevanmukta, which means
that he has attained liberation while living only, and he attains the
supreme state of Brahman after the ending of his life-period.
(20) Many Seers like King Janaka, by following the teaching of Geeta
are freed of all sins, are applauded in this world and have reached the
highest abode of Brahman.
(21) He who reads Geeta but does not read this chapter about the
greatness of Geeta, will get only hard work and his recitation will be
fruitless.
(22) He who recites and studies Geeta together with this chapter about
its greatness, will surely attain its fruit and his attainment in the
higher worlds will be exceptionally high, very rare in all the world.
