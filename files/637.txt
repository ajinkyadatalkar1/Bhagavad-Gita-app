giving, that charity becomes flawless and pure.
य ु प युपकाराथ फलमुि य वा पुनः|
दीयते च प रि ल ं त ानं राजसं मृतम्
But, with an expectation of returns or receiving some fruit in exchange, if the charity is given with
much anguish in our mind, that charity is called Rajasic (21)
(285) But just as a cow is fed with a motive that it will give milk or seeds are sown in a field with
the aim of filling the godown with grains,
(286) Or just as with an eye on the receiving of a good present, a relative is invited to attend some

(292) And the giver, while giving even that little something is having a remoarse in his mind as if all

That charity which is given at wrong place, at wrong time, to non-deserving persons and given
without respect and with insults is called Tamasic charity. (22)
