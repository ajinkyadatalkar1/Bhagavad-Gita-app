अ तव त इमे देहा िन य यो ाः शरी रणः|
अनािशनोऽपमेय य त मा ु य व भारत
These bodies, of the holder of the bodies, who is permanent are said to be having an end; The
holder of the body is indestructible and immeasurable! O Bharata! Therefore you should fight. (18)
(136) And this body is in itself naturally perishable. Therefore, O Son of Pandu, you should fight.
य एनं वेि ह तारं य ैनं म यते हतम्|
उभौ तौ न िवजानीतो नायं हि त न ह यते
One who knows Atman as a "killer" and the one who knows him as “killed”, - both these really
do not properly understand; because he neither kills nor is killed. (19)
(137) You are identifying yourself with the body and taking in view the physical body you are
thinking that you are the "killer" and these are the “killed”.
(138) But O Arjuna, you do not know this fact. If you consider the reality, you are not the "killer" and
these are not the “killed’.
न जायते िमयते वा कदािच नायं भू वा भिवता वा न भूयः|
अजो िन यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न ह यते ह यमाने शरीरे
वेदािवनािशनं िन यं य एनमजम ययम्|
कथं स पु षः पाथ क
ं घातयित हि त कम्
The Atman is never born, nor dies, nor does He exist only after birth. For it is unborn, eternal,
everlasting and ancient. Even though the body is being slain, He is not slain. (20)
O Arjuna, the man who knows this Atman to be imperishable, eternal and free from birth and
decay - how and whom will he cause to be killed, or kill? (21)
(139) This is like one who is dreaming, thinks whatever he sees there to be true, but when he is
awake, he does not see these things.
(140) O king, know that this illusion is like that. You are in vain being deluded. It is just like a
shadow which is not hurt even if it is beaten with a weapon.
(141) If a jar full of water is toppled, the water is spilt and the reflection of the Sun in it seems to be
gone, but the Sun is not destroyed with that reflection.
