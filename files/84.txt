(364) Just as a fastidious man who thinks that nectar is also not so tasty, never enjoys corn soup,
similarly a man of self-realization does not fall for enjoying the riches or occult powers.
(365) O Partha, just see the beauty of it! Where even the heavenly happiness is not worth
considering, how can the worldly prosperity or occult powers be valued?
िवहाय कामान् यः सवान् पुमां रित िन पृहः|
िनममो िनरहंकारः स शाि तमिधग छित
He who, having given up all desires, moves freely without any wish, any attachment and any
pride, attains the inner peace. (71)
(366) So, one who is satisfied with the joy in the Atman, and is nourished on the highest bliss, is the
man of steady intellect - whom you should thus recognize.
(367) He punishes the pride of egoism, discards all the desires and lives in the universe, himself
becoming the universal consciousness.
एषा बा ी ि थितः पाथ नैनां पा य िवमु ित|
ि थ वाऽ याम तकालेऽिप ब िनवाणमृ छित
O Partha, this is the state of Brahman. Having reached this state, he never gets deluded; and
having been established in this state even at the time of the end of his body, he attains the supreme
bliss in Brahman. (72)
(368) Those who, having discarded desire, enjoy this state of bliss have reached the Brahman very
easily,
(369) When they are thus united in the spirit, even the acute pains at the time of death do not become
an impediment in the way of their maintaining the state of peace.
(370) Sanjaya said - “This is the state of Brahman about which the Lord is telling personally to
Arjuna.
(371) Listening to this statement of Lord Shri Krishna, Arjuna thought to himself - “This argument of
Shri Krishna is going to be helpful to me.
(372) As the Lord has discarded all the action altogether, his incentive to me to fight is now
baseless."
(373) Thus Arjuna was elated in his mind by the speech of Lord Krishna, and he will now ask a
question, raising some doubt.
