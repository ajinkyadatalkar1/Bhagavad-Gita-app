(361) "I shall give whatever those people want who will praise me and please me by their poetry,
dance and other entertainments.
(362) "I shall be expert in taking intoxicating drinks and I shall be happy in the embrace of beautiful
women and thus I will proudly show off how I am the happiest man in the world.
(363) What to say about these people! These are so maddened by evil character that they in vain try
foolishly to smell the flowers in the sky!

Being erratically pulled here and there by conflicting thoughts and caught in the net of greedy
enticements, they become attached to enjoyment of their desires, as a result of which they fall into the
dirty hell. (16)
(364) Like a man in delirium babbles anything, these people talk nonsense by the force of their
misguided concepts.
(365) Being filled up by the dust of ignorance, they are blown away by the hurricane of hope and
whirl round in the air of aspirations.
(366) They continuously desire many objects of senses, just as the clouds at the pre-monsoon period
know no break, or the sea waves never stop.
(367) Then these desires become the inner bunch of creepers in their consciousness and jus as lotus
may be scratched by thorns,
(368) Or Arjuna, just as an earthen pot should be broken on a stove, the souls of these people are
shattered.
(369) Just as with advancing dark night, the darkness deepens, the confusion in the minds of these
people goes on increasing.
(370) With increasing confusion, their attraction towards sense-objects also increases, and in the
very growing attraction, sins easily find anchor.
(371) When their sins increase, they suffer so much that their life is a living hell.
(372) Therefore, O wise one, where do they go at last, who pamper and indulge into satisfying their
evil desires?
(373) They go where there are trees with leaves as swords, mountains of burning coals of Khaira
