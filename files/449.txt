you have done well.
(640) That knowledge to attain which the seekers undertake very difficult practises of Yoga etc. is in
itself extra-ordinarily satisfying to our heart and moreover there is your interesting style of
commentary! What more is there to expect?
(641) Who will be bored if it is the rain of nectar continuously coming down for seven days? And
even if crores of happy days are there, will anybody enquire as to when they are going to end, by
counting them?
(642) If the full moon night extends for a complete duration of an Age, will not the birds 'Chakora'
keep on staring at the moon, without being tired?
(643) Similarly who will say enough, when the subject is of real knowledge, and we are lucky to
listen to such an interesting commentary?
(644) If the guest who has come for dinner is really a gourmet and the lady, who serves the dinner is
a good cook, the food will be enjoyed tremendously.
(645) Similar is this occasion, because, we are already interested in this knowledge and you have
great liking for speaking about it.
(646) Therefore, our attention to this commentary has become four times greater and, therefore, we
cannot help saying that you are the real seer of knowledge.
(647) Now, please enter the 'central hall' of intellect and please tell us at length about the remaining
terms of the verse."
(648) As soon as the listeners said this the disciple of Nivritti said, "Sirs! That is the very intention
of mine!
(649) And, in addition I am asked by saints like you. Therefore, I shall not prolong my fanciful
deliberation.
(650) Now, please see that the Lord Krishna told to the great archer Arjuna, eighteen signs of
knowledge,
(651) And then said, "This should be known as knowledge. This is my opinion and the opinion of
many other men of knowledge."
(652) We have shown to you the nature of knowledge so clearly as an emblica on the palm.
(653) Now, O the clever Dhananjaya, we will now tell you what is ignorance with all its signs.
