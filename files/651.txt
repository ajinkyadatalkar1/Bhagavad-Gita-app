(17) O the symbol of all my worship! I have understood this very well
as the most secret thing about you, that you are realised in oneness
only when we totally drop every kind of distinction and duality.
(18) Therefore what more can I say? Please accept my salutations as salt
is absorbed in the liquid tasty juices of boiled vegetable!
(19) Now just as an empty pot is dipped in the sea and taken out, it
comes filled with water, or just as the wick, when touched by a flame,
becomes itself a flame-
(20) Similarly O Shri Nivritti! by bowing before you I have become
fulfilled. Therefore I will proceed to explain the meaning of Geeta
further.
(21) (Dnyanadeva begins to talk about Geeta)- "Now at the end of the
sixteenth chapter, in its last verse, the Lord has emphatically given
direction to the effect that-
(22) "O Partha, you have to abide by the orders given by the scriptures
as the standard in the matter of deciding right action and wrong
action."
(23) There Arjuna thought, "How is it that no action can be done
without the help of scriptures?
(24) How can one stand on the hood of the great serpent Takshaka and
take out the gem from his head? And how can one pluck the hair from
the nose of a lion?
(25) And then if we have to sew that gem by the thread of that hair, then
only we can put the garland around our neck! If this is not possible,
should we keep our neck without ornament?
