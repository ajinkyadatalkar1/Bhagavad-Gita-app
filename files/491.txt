with the signs of discrimination.
(19) I have an aspiration to open up the hidden meaning of the Geeta
and therefore, I pray that you may apply the divine ointment to my
inner eye, which is your benediction.
(20) You may please rise with your whole compassion and give me
light so that my intellectual eyes will see at a glance the whole world
or literature.
(21) O the supreme among the compassionate teachers! I pray that you
may become that spring season which makes the vine of my intuition
bear the fruit of Poetry itself.
(22) Sir, let your benedictory glance shower on me your kindness in
such profusion that the Ganges of my intellect will be flooded with
the final doctrines of philosophy.
(23) O the resting place of all the universe, let the moon of my intuition
be endowed with the inspiration of the full-moon!
(24) By the glimpse of that full-moon, my sea of knowledge will have
high tide and it will overflow with all the nine literary moods.
(25) Listening to this, the Guru saidâ€“ "By way of requesting me, you
are again praising me.
(26) But enough of this unnecessary praise. Please continue with the
very fragrant commentary of this book. Do not try our patience and
dilute our eagerness.
(27) Dnyandeva said- "Is it so, sir! I was simply waiting for the words-
"Please continue" to be spoken by you!"
