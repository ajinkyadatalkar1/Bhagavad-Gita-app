(301) Please see how the tortoise spreads its limbs and withdraws them itself when it wishes.
(302) Similarly he whose senses are under his control and obey what he wishes, has attained
steadiness of intellect.
िवषया िविनवत ते िनराहार य देिहनः|
रसवज रसोऽ य य परं वा िनवतते
Sense-objects turn away from a person who does not accept them but for some time his yearning
remains hidden in him, and this inward interest also diminishes to nothing when such a man has a
glimpse of that which is the supreme. (59)
(303) O Arjuna, I will tell you something more interesting. The seekers make it a habit to discard the
sense-objects regularly.
(304) People control other organs like ears, eyes, etc. but do not control the tongue, and thus the
sense-objects catch them in thousands of ways.
(305) If you will only cut the tender leaves of a tree but continue to pour water at its roots, then how
can you destroy the tree totally?
(306) As that tree will grow horizontally with renewed force, so the sense-objects become fully
grown through the door of the tongue.
(307) Other senses can be thwarted and controlled but the tongue cannot be easily controlled
because we cannot live without eating.
(308) Then, O Arjuna, that taste also turns away from us when we have the glimpse of the Absolute
Brahman and become united with it.
(309) Then attachment to the body and similar other identifications with the body are gone, the
senses forget their former interests in the outer objects, when the direct experience of “I AM
THAT” arises.
यततो िप कौ तेय पु ष य िवपि तः|
इि दयािण पमाथीिन हरि त पसभं मनः
O Kounteya, turbulent by nature, the senses of even a man of determination who may be actually
trying self-control, forcibly carry away his mind astray. (60)
(310) O Arjuna, even for those who try continuously to control these sense-organs, it is not easily
possible to achieve.
