such a devotee and the lotus which decorates my hand is used by me to offer as
worship to him.
(224) I have grown two more arms in order to enable me to embrace such a devotee
with all my body.
(225) Being without body, I take up this body just for enjoyment of the company of
such a devotee. Actually, my love for such a devotee is having nothing equal
anywhere.
(226, 227) There is no wonder that I have got pure and intimate friendship with such
a devotee, but over and above this, there is no doubt that I love with my heart and
soul, even those people, who describe the life-story of these devotees with respect.
(228) Dear Arjuna, this Yoga of devotion which I have told you in details is the
highest Yoga.
(229) This Yoga is so powerful that because of this I hold my devotee very dear, I
always think about him or even hold him high on my head-through sheer
adoration.
ये तु ध यामृतिमदं यथो ं पयुपासते|
श धाना म परमा भ ा तेऽतीव मे िपयाः
Those who follow in practice, this pure religious teaching which is like nectar, and those who
have faith in me and are devoted ardently to me are very very dear to me. (20)
(230) Those who listen to this religious shower of nectar, which is very interesting and turn it into
actual experience,
(231) And those who have great faith by which this teaching increases and occupies the whole life
force and soul, while they are actually practising it,
(232) The state of their mind is exactly as described by me just now and therefore, this teaching is,
in their case, like good seed sown in a fertile field.
(233) Even then they love me with their tremendous adoration and by considering this devotion as
the most valuable treasure, give their whole life for it -
(234) Dear Partha, these are the real devotees and the real Yogis because they are always eagerly
devoted to me.
