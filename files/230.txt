O Arjuna, all the worlds from the Brahmaloka (the heaven where Brahma the creator exists)
downwards are liable to appear and reappear, but, O son of Kunti, on attaining me there is no rebirth.
(16)
(152) Generally, even after having reached the proud level of Brahma the cycle of birth and death
cannot be avoided but just as a dead person has no stomach-ache,
(153) Or nobody who is awakened, is drowned in the flood seen in a dream; similarly those who
have reached me do not get smeared by the dirt of earthly life.
(154) The world of Brahma is in the normal sense, the head of the world of ‘name and form’, it is the
greatest thing as regards the quality of permanency and it is the highest peak of the mountain of the
universe.
(155) That world of Brahma is such that one Indra’s life is not equal to 1/8th part of the day of it and
while one day of the world of Brahma is complete, within that period, fourteen Indras come and
go - one by one.

The yogis who know from realization that Brahma’s day is of a thousand Great Ages of humans
and his night also as extending to another thousand Great Ages of humans, are the knowers of Reality
about the Day and Night.
(156) When one thousand groups of four human ages each lapse, then, only one day of the region of
God Brahma is over and when one thousand groups of four human ages each lapse more, one
night is over in that region,
(157) Where such is the duration of the day and night, the fortunate yogis who dwell there remain
witnesses of all, by being deathless themselves,
(158) There ordinary goals are not at all to be taken into account, because within that duration,
fourteen Indras are finished!
(159) But those who witness even the day and night of 8 parts of 3 hours each, of the God Brahma,
are known as knowers of the cosmic day and night.
