him with tremendous love.
(8) He is talking with Arjuna about that secret knowledge which he did
not tell his mother Devaki, and did not tell even his brother
Balibhadra.
(9) The Goddess Laxmi is so intimate with him, but she also did not
witness such happiness in love, and only Arjuna was lucky to receive
the great love of Shri Krishna.
(10) Sanaka and others had very high hopes to receive such love but
even they could not be compared in regard to success in that respect
which Arjuna got.
(11) The love of the Lord of the world to Arjuna was unparalleled. How
grand was the merit of Arjuna!
(12) For him the unmanifest God has taken worldly incarnation. I see
both of them as one only.
(13) Otherwise this God is not found by yogis, Vedas cannot
understand him, and in meditation he is not visible by the inner eye.
(14) He is in his original nature such a beginningless, unshakable and
eternal being, but one cannot understand how he is so kind.
(15) This Shri Krishna is like all the three worlds neatly folded in one
fold, but he is also the far shore of formed existence, and see how he
has come as human being for the love of Arjuna.
