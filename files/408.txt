authority over it?"
(59) Even though you definitely know the power of death over this field, you are adamant about your
own opinion..
(60) This field is as if the image of angry death, or the cave of a lion! But how can the babbling fools
like you know this?
(61) This lion who is Death, jumps even beyond the Kalpa and devours the elephant that is
Satyaloka, the highest world where Brahma the creator rules.
(62) This lion who is Death, eats up new regents and presiding deities of all the worlds and the
directions like east, west etc., continuously, by penetrating into the heaven.
(63) And the other Jeevas, the weaklings like deers, become dead even by the breeze coming from
the body of this Lion of Death and fall into abysmal depths.
(64) Just see the jaw of this Lion! See how big it is! The elephant which is the whole universe is
being gulped down in this jaw!
(65) Therefore, there is unhindered power of death over this field. "O the son of Pandu! there are
many arguments regarding what this field is.
(66) Lots of discussions have been held by wise sages about this in Naimish forest and mythological
books are proofs showing the varieties of opinions in this regard.
(67) Even in the present times, arguments vehementhy made in the Vedas in their various meters are
alluded to, in order to prove the truth in each and every opinion.
(68) The Greater Sama-hymn of the Vedas is very pure as regards its wisdom, but even that hymn
has not been able to penetrate the riddle about this field.
(69) In addition to these, many seers and poets have exhausted their intellectual reserves in order to
decide its nature and structure.
(70) But nobody has really understood what this field is, what is its limit and scope or whose
property it is.
(71) Now I shall tell you from the beginning to the end, all the things about this field.
