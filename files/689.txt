(29) Then Dnyandeva requested- "This is in itself your blessing; is it
not? So, I humbly request that attention may please be paid to the
speech on this great Treatise further."
(30) This is really the top dome made of Chintamani gems built on the
temple of Geeta which itself is studded with jewels, and being full of
meaning, this is going to illuminate the hidden significance of Geeta.
(31) In everyday life, we can see the dome of a temple from a distance
also, and when we see it, it is equal to have seen and met the deity in
that temple.
(32) Same is the case here; because by this one chapter the whole
meaning of Geeta comes within the view of our inward eye.
(33) That is why I say that Badarayana Vyasa has raised this chapter as
a peak, or a top dome of the temple of Geeta.
(34) And, by looking at the end-verses of this chapter, it is also evident
that after the building of the dome, no more construction remains to
be built.
(35) The sage Vyasa, a great skillful architect, excavated a quarry in the
rocky plateau in the form of Upanishads, on the mountain of gems
which is the Vedas.
(36) Then he built a fortification of Mahabharata with all the mateial of
the three objects of ordinary human life which are religion, riches and
desires, around that rocky plateau.
(37) In the form of the dialogue between the Lord Shrikrishna and
Arjuna, he then cleaned the structure and the place which represents
the pure self-knowledge.
