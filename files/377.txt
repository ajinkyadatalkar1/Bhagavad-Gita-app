अजुन उवाच -
वेदं मानुषं पं तव सौ यं जनादन|
इदानीमि म संवृ ः सचेताः पक

Arjuna said- Having seen, O Janardana, your human form which is mild, I am now self-
composed, and have come back to normal senses. (51).
(663) In this way the brave Arjuna saw what he requested for and then said - ‘‘Saved! I am really
saved!’’
(664) My intellect was devoid of common awareness and there was tremendous fear like that in the
wilderness. Mind had gone away together with consciousness that "I am".
(665) My senses had become forgetful of their functions, speech had missed its liveliness. Such was
the chaotic condition in the town of senses in my body.
(666) All of them have again become normal and I am feeling that I am alive when I am seeing this
human form of Shrikrishna.
(667) Having felt such comfort in his soul, he said to Shrikrishna, "I have now seen your human
form.
(668) My God! By showing me this human form again, you have given me that satisfaction and relief
which a mother gives to her child by breast-feeding it.
(669) I was fighting with both hands with the huge waves in the sea of that universal form from
which, now I have reached the shore of this small human form of yours."
