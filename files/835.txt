There is fire within the sea, which heats up the water and still the sea
supplies it with more water.

Krishna says - "I am still maintaining the print of his foot on my
chest''.
The sage Bhrugu decided to find out who among the three Gods is the
greatest in Godly virtues. He went to God Brahma and also God
Shankara whose response to him was not befitting their position, but
when he went to God Vishnu and trying to test his patience and
forgiveness kicked that God on his chest, the God Vishnu was not at all
disturbed. Instead he got up and carefully massaged the foot of Bhrugu
lest the hitting on his own hard chest should be painful to that most
revered Brahmin. Bhrugu was pleased with the benign behaviour of
Vishnu and decided that Vishnu is the most virtuous God. The mark left
by the kick of the foot of Bhrugu on his chest is always shining like a
gem and is called "Shree Vatsa'' (in old books).

The Lord Shankar placed half moon on his forehead with a hope that
it would give some coolness.
When the milk-ocean was churned by gods and demons, fourteen
divine things came out. One of them was the heaviest poison by name
Halahala, None of the Gods and demons were willing to take it, so, in
order to save the world form disastrous death, Lord Shankar took the
poison, but it was so hot that the Lord kept the cool moon on his
forehead to alleviate his suffering due to that poison. He also put cool
serpents around his neck, and started repeating the coolest name of all,
i.e. the name of Rama.
