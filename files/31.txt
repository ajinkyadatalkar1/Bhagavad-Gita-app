(115) Among these, the greatest of all the Kshatriyas, the senior-most of the fighters of the world is
Bheeshma who has been honoured as commander-in-chief.
(116) And all this army being covered and protected by the power of Bheeshma, seems like a great
fort, properly built and the three worlds as if appear smaller than it.
(117) Ocean is originally already difficult to be crossed and the fire in the ocean may add its
ferocity to it;
(118) Or the fires of total destruction and the great tornado may come together. Similar is the case
with Bheeshma, the son of Ganga, being the commander-in-chief.
(119) Now, who can confront this army? On the other hand, the army of Pandavas is very small, but
even that army appears to be vast.
(120) Over and above this, the burly Bheema is the leader of that army-’’ So saying Duryodhana
ended his speech.
अयनेषु च सवषु यथाभागमवि थताः|
भी ममेवािभर तु भव तः सव एव िह
Therefore, stationed in your respective chariots at positions on all fronts, you should all guard
Bheeshma in particular on all sides. (11)
(121) Then again he addressed all his soldiers, "Now keep all your companies well-arrayed."
(122) All leaders should see that the great chariotriders who have been given the charge of their
respective Akshouhini (divisions of army).
(123) Exercise proper control over the division and be under the command of Bheeshma." Again
Duryodhana turned to Drona and said, "Please listen! All of you -"
(124) Should protect Bheeshma alone by respecting him as equal to me, because the strength of all
our army is dependant upon him.
त य संजनयन् हष क
ु वृ ः िपतामहः|
िसंहनादं िवन ो चैः शंखं द मौ पतापवान्
The grand old man of the Kaurava race, their glorious, grand-uncle Bheeshma, cheering up
Duryodhana, roared terribly like a lion and blew his conch. (12)
(125) Listening to these words of the King, the commander-in-chief was pleased and he roared.
