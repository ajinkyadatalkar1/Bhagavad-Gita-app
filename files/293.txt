(56) The more heated the gold is the more and more it shines. Therefore, we like to purify it further
and further.
(57) Similarly, O Partha, we are not obliging you at all. We are going to talk further out of our own
interest.
(58) This is like a mother, who puts ornaments on her little child. The child does not know anything
about beauty etc.; but all the enjoyment is evident in the eyes of the mother.
(59) Similarly as your happiness goes on increasing, our own joy is doubled. That is a fact.
(60) Now, O Arjuna, let this figuritive expression be kept aside. Since I am frankly in love with you,
I am not satisfied enough while talking to you.
(61) It is for this reason that we talk to you the same thing again and again. That is all. Now please
attain to it with your mind and heart.
(62) Therefore, listen to this essential secret which is absolute Brahman which has come to embrace
you by donning the garment of letters.
(63) But O Arjuna, you are not knowing me perfectly and definitely. My dear, what you see as ‘‘me
standing before you,’’ is virtualy the whole universe.
न मे िवदुः सुरगणाः पभवं न महषयः|
अहमािदिह देवानां महष णां च सवशः
All the gods and great sages do not know my origin. I am the origin of all the gods and these sages
in all respects. (2)
(64) Here, the Vedas became mute. The mind and the Vital breath became lame, and the Sun and the
Moon have set, irrespective of whether it is day or night.
(65) My dear, just as the child in the womb of a mother cannot know the age of its mother, similarly I
cannot be known by all gods.
(66) And the sea is the limit of aquatic animals; and insects cannot go beyond the sky. Similarly the
knowledge of the great sages cannot see me.
(67) The whole greater Ages have lapsed in deciding as to who I am, how much I am, of whom and
how I came into being.
(68) This is because, I am the root cause of all the great sages and gods and also all the other beings;
and therefore it is difficult to know me.
