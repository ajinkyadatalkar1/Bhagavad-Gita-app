house or the sons.
(601) He considers desirable and undesirable things with equal detachment, just as occans are the
same in both the summer and the rainy season.
(602) Or just as the Sun does not change though we have the morning, the noon and the evening, he is
having no disturbance in his mind though there may be pain or pleasure.
(603) You should know that in such a man who is as serene as the sky, the 'knowledge' comes to
reside of its own accord.
मिय चान ययोगेन भि र यिभचा रणी|
िविव देशसेिव वमरितजनसंसिद
And he has undeviated one-pointed devotion to me, and he resides in a secluded place because he
is averse to crowds of people. (10)
(604) And he has a determined conviction that there is nothing better than I Myself in the world,
(605) His body, speech and mind are completely saturated with this juice of conviction by which
they do not perceive anything other than Myself anywhere.
(606) Or his inner soul is so near Me that his bed is My own bed and we sleep together on the Atmic
bed.
(607) He becomes so merged into Me just as the wife does not hesitate either in her mind or by her
body while sleeping with her husband.
(608) As the Ganges meets the sea and keeps continuously so meeting, such devotees keep on
meeting Me even after being united with me.
(609) It behoves the light of the Sun to come with the Sun at sunrise and go with it at the time of
sunset.
(610) It is water itself moving on the water, but people call it the 'wave', through it is water only.
(611) Similarly he who is such a devotee, who weds Me though he is already so wedded, is the
knowledge virtually embodied.
(612) And such a devotee likes to reside at places of pilgrimage, banks of sacred rivers, pure places
useful for penance, caves, forests and mountains, etc.
(613) He selects for his residence such valleys of mountains or the environment of large lakes, but
does not come to reside in the city.
