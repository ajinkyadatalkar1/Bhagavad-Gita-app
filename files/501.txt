तत स वं िनमल वा पकाशकमनामयम्|
सुखसंगेन ब नाित ानसंगेन चानघ
O the sinless Arjuna, in this process the Sattwa quality being pure, giver of light and good health,
binds the Atman by association with pleasant conditions. (6)
(148) Similarly this hunter called by the name Sattwa, pulls the nets of pleasure and knowledge in
which the Atman gets caught just as a deer.
(149) Then he boasts of his knowledge, gets too much elated by his ego, and loses the real happiness
in the Atman, which is so near him.
(150) He is very happy, if somebody gives him respect and he becomes elated, if he gets a little
pleasure, boasting, "Am I not very lucky? Is there anybody happier than myself?" and he is
subjected to the eight kinds of pious ecstacies.
(152) This does not stop here. There is some additional factor of pride. He is possessed by the ghost
of being a clever man.
(153) Not caring about his loss of own natural abode of all knowledge, he becomes as vast as the
sky due to pride, by the little objective knowledge of things.
(154) This is like a king, who dreams that he is a beggar and when he gets some grains in charity, he
says, "Am I not very fortunate like Indra?"
(155) Similarly Atman, who is alone without any form becomes embodied and considers himself as
a soul, attached to the body and becomes deluded by outer knowledge.
(156) He becomes clever in the outward activities, knows the ritualistic sacrifices thoroughly and
thinks that heaven is just near him because of his being knowledgable.
(157) Now he boasts, "There is nobody as wise as I am and as the moon shines in the sky, my
wisdom shines in my mind."
(158) Thus, by pulling the rope of pleasure and knowledge, which is tied around the neck, the Sattwa
quality turns the man into a bull used by some mendicants for religious shows.
(159) Now please listen, how this soul, or jeeva is tied down by the quality of Rajas, which is being
told.
