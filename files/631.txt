(213) When the actions and behaviour of the physical body will be so pure and humble, one should
know that the physical penance has become a perfected thing.
(214) O Partha, since in all these activities, the main instrument is physical body, I call this penance
as physical.
(215) Thus, I have discussed the physical penance. Now please listen to the purity of penance of
Speech.
अनु ेगकरं वा यं स यं िपयिहतं च यत्|
वा याया यसनं चैव वा यं तप उ यते
To speak in such a way that it does not hurt anybody, it is true and it is helpful for the welfare as
well as it is likable. Similarly to study about self-knowledge- This all is called the penance of
speech. (15)
(216) As the magic-stone Parees transforms iron into gold without taking out any part from it;
(217) When the speech is similar to it, which does not hurt anyone's feelings and is kind and makes
men happy who are near.
(218) When the speech is addressed to one man but it also becomes helpful to all others like water
given to the roots of one tree, gives life to the grass around it;
(219) If Ganges is of nectar, it certainly makes one deathless, but also makes us cool and pure by
removing the heat and blemishes, by our bathing in it.
(220) Similarly the speech which discards bad indiscriminate thinking, our real beginningless,
eternal nature is revealed and one never gets bored while listening to it because it is sweet as
nectar.
(221) If at all someone asks something, then there is talk, otherwise one may continue with one's
study of Veda-recitation;
(222) Such a man, actually establishes all the three Vedas in the home of his speech and has as if
started a Vedic school in his speech.
(223) Or he continuously chants some name of God, either of the Lord Vishnu or that of the Lord
Shiva- such is the nature of penance of speech.
(224) After this the great leader of the Lords of all worlds, the Lord Shrikrishna, said "Now listen to
the nature of penance by the mind, which we shall presently tell you.
