identified and united with the state or the thing he imagines.
(73) When a soul broods even a particular thing persistantly, while he is awake, he sees the same
thing in dream as soon as he sleeps, closing his eyes.
(74) Similarly, while living, if the soul has not fulfilled any particular desire about a thing, his
attraction increases tremendously at the time of the bodily death.
(75) And generally the soul takes the next birth of that which he remembers at the time of death.
Therefore you should always remember me only.
त मा सवषु कालेषु मामनु मर यु य च|
म यिपतमनोबुि मामेवै य यसंशयम्
Therefore think of me at all times and fight. With your mind and intellect thus surrendered to me,
you will undoubtedly come unto me finally. (7)
(76) Whatever you see by your eyes, listen by your ears, think by your mind or speak with your
tongue,
(77) That should be performed by yourself being merged into me, so that I will be always naturally
with you everywhere.
(78) O Arjuna, if you can manage this successfully, you have no cause for fear even if you die. Then
what fear is there in fighting?
(79) I swear that if you really offer your heart and mind and intellect to me as the Atman, you will
definitely be one with me.
(80) If you doubt whether this will happen or not, check it by your own study and experience and if it
is not successful, then you can very well get angry with me.
अ यासयोगयु े न चेतसा ना यगािमना|
परमं पु षं िद यं याित पाथानुिच तयन्
O Partha, with the mind not deviating anywhere, constantly meditating on me by yogic practice,
the yogi reaches the divine glorious Purusha, that is myself. (8)
(81) My Dear, this yoga of action cleans the mind and makes it strong by such study. This is just like
a lame person, who climbs a mountain by using some tact.
(82) Similarly you should direct your consciousness by the study of yoga of action towards the path
of Parabrahman. Then there will be no worry whether the body remains or dies.
