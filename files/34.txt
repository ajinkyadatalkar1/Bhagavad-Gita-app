(147) These two sounds became one, which made one fear whether the whole universe was about to
be shattered in hundreds of pieces.
(148) In the next moment Bheemasena became agitated as if the God of death was tremendously
angry; and he blew his great conch named Poundra.
(149) While the sound of that conch echoed and re-echoed like the thunder of the great clouds at the
time of total destruction, Yudhishthira sounded his conch, which was named Ananta-Vijaya.
(150) Similarly Nakula sounded his conch Sughosha and Sahadeva, his conch Manipushpak, the
sound of which conches made the God Yama greatly afraid.

And the excellent archer, the King of Kashi, and Shikhandi the great chariotrider,
Dhrushtadyumna and Virata, and invincible S¢tyaki, Drupada as well as the five sons of Draupadi,
and the mighty-armed Abhimanyu, son of Subhadra, all of them, O Lord of the earth, severally blew
their respective conches, on all sides. (17-18)
And the terrible sound, echoing through heaven and earth, rent the hearts of Dhritarastra’s sons.
(19)
(151) There were many kings in the field, such as Drupada, the sons of Draupadi and the long -
armed King of Kashi.
(152) The son of Arjuna, the invincible S¢tyaki, Dhristadyumna who was a king and also
Shikhandi.
(153) The kings like Vir¢ta etc. who were the leading warriors in the army also blew
various conches incessantly.
(154) By that great sound, the Tortoise and the divine Serpent in the nether world
were afraid and about to give up the burden of the earth.
