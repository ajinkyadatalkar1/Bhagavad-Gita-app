the subject of experience of saints, and where those who are masters
of the experience of unity with THAT, always get themselves
absorbed.
(54) This is listened to by devotees. This is first saluted with respect in
all the three worlds, and will be told in the section of Mahabharata
which is dedicated to the description of war when Bheeshma was the
Commander General; in the flow of the story.
(55) It is called Bhagawadgeeta. The God Brahma and the God
Shankara praise it and the sages led by Sanaka reverently follow it.
(56) & (57) The listeners are requested to appreciate the sweetness of
this story making their minds as sensitive and tender as the young
ones of the bird Chakora enjoy the delicate moon-rays in the Sharad
season, as if they are little drops of nectar.
(58) This story is such that it should be narrated without words, should
be understood without the knowledge of senses, and the essential
principle of it should be grasped even before it is spoken.
(59) The petals of lotus do not know it when the pollen is taken away
by the blue beetles. Similar is the case in respect of enjoying the
listening to this book.
(60) Only the lily knows how to enjoy the embrace of the moon-light
without leaving its place.
(61) Only he who is having a steady mind with all the seriousness, can
understand this subject (of Geeta).
(62) O the listeners, who are sages and who are worthy of sitting by the
side of Arjuna (in their capacity to listen, and to act), may please pay
attention.
