therefore come unto me by constant study.
अ यासेऽ यसमथ ऽिस म कमपरमो भव|
मदथमिप कमािण क
ु वन् िसि मवा यिस
And if you are not capable of studying, then be a person who performs actions for me. You can
achieve perfection even by performing your duties for me. (10)
(114) Or if you have no capacity even for this study, then you may stay and live as and where you
are.
(115) Do not control your sense organs, do not deny yourself enjoyment of objects, and do not
intentionally leave your normal pride about your caste.
(116) Follow the regular family traditions of religious etc. activities, abide by rules of avoiding or
performing certain actions. You are at liberty to behave as a normal member of the society.
(117) But whatever actions you may perform by mind, speech or body, you should not say that you
are the 'doer.'
(118) To do or not to do any action is known only by the Paramatmanan, who directs all the
functions in the universe.
(119) You should not think whether any action is complete or incomplete, but continue to maintain
yourself in life by total one-pointedness of your soul.
(120) As water in the garden follows quietly the paths prepared for it by the gardener, so easily you
should remain peaceful while performing whatever actions present themselves, without having
ego of being a 'doer'.
(121) Therefore, do not have the burden of choosing to be active in the outer
world or to be withdrawn inwardly, but keep your mind riveted constantly to me.
(122) For example, Dear Arjuna, does the chariot bother whether the path is straight or having
various turns?
(123) Thus you should peacefully offer to me whatever action is taking place, in a peaceful mood of
your mind, not thinking whether it is complete or incomplete, small or big.
(124) If your attitude is like this, O Arjuna, then you will come to the 'home' of my unity with you,
when your physical body comes to an end.
