शीभगवानुवाच -
अशो यान वशोच वं प ावादां भाषसे|
गतासूनगतासूं नानुशोचि त पि डताः
The Lord said - “You grieve over those who are not worth grieving for, and yet you speak the
words full of intellectual argument! Wise people do not lament over the dead or the living. (11)
(91) Then he said to Arjuna - We are seeing a really surprising thing here that you are giving scope
to such feelings in the nick of time.
(92) Though you consider yourself as a man of knowledge, you do not drop your ignorance and if we
set about to teach you, you are giving us a tall talk about morality.
(93) Your wisdom appears to me just like a born-blind man becoming mad and running healter-
skelter!
(94) You know not your real self and are going to lament for these Kauravas; which has caused great
astonishment in our mind, which we are feeling again and again.
(95) So, now tell me, O Arjuna! Is this universe created by you? Is it not true that this universe is
beginningless?
(96) They say that “There is one Almighty God and all the beings are born from him.” Is all that a
meaningless babble?
(97) Or is it today proved that all this is born, if created by you only, and will be destroyed only if
you destroy it? Please think over this.
(98) If out of your confused state of mind you do not intend to slay these, does it logically follow that
these people will live forever?
(99) Or do you hold the illusory concept that only you are the slayer and only all the world-
population is going to die?
(100) Actually all this existence is as it is, without any beginning and it is by its own nature, born
and comes to an end! Tell me why you should become sorry for it.
(101) But you do not realize this due to your stupidity, worry about it in vain and over and above,
give us lessons on morality!
(102) Just see this; those who are really having some discrimination, know that it is an illusion that
things appear and disappear, and therefore they do not become sorry by both the happenings.
