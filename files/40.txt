(202) and then even if there is danger of its death, it cannot break open the petal of the lotus;
similarly this affection becomes hard to cut because of its delicate softness.
(203) This attachment is the divine power of Adinarayana and even the god Brahma cannot
understand it. Therefore, O King! She could confuse Arjuna.
(204) Sanjaya further said, “Please listen. Then Arjuna having seen all his relatives, lost all his
intention and determination to fight.
(205) One cannot define, how this pity entered and captured his mind. He then said to Lord
Shrikrishna, “It is better not to be here.”
(206) My heart is tremendously disturbed and by the very concept that we have to kill all these, I am
not able to utter even a word. The power of my speech is as if gone astray.
िनिम ािन च प यािम िवपरीतािन क
े शव|
न च शेयोऽनुप यािम ह वा वजनमाहवे
And, further O Keshava, I see many evil omens. I do not see any good, any merit in killing my
kinsmen in the battle. (31)
(207) If it is right for us that we should kill Kauravas, then why not kill Dharma (Yudhishthira) etc.?
Are they not from our own family?
(208) Therefore I say, ‘Let this battle be abandoned! I cannot understand what business we have got
to commit this great sin.
(209) O God, considering all the angles I feel that it will be very undesirable to fight here. Rather, if
at all something good will come out of anything, it will be by avoiding this battle.
न का े िवजयं क
ृ ण न च रा यं सुखािन च|
िक
ं नो रा येन गोिव द िक
ं भोगैज िवतेन वा
O Krishna, I have no ambition to gain victory or kingdom or pleasures. O Govinda, what have we
to do with such kingdom, such pleasures or even such a life? (32)
येषामथ काि तं नो रा यं भोगाः सुखािन च|
त इमेऽवि थता यु े पाणां य वा धनािन च
Those for whose sake we had desired the kingdom, the pleasures and enjoyments, are all standing
here in this battle, having already staked there life as well as possessions. (33)
