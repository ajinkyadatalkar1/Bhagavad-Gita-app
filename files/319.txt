Thus, in the Upanishad sung by the Lord Shrikrishna, in the knowledge of the Brahman, in the
science of Yoga, in the dialogue between Shrikrishna and Arjuna, the Tenth Chapter by name "Yoga
of Manifestation" is ended. (10)

Chapter - 11
The Yoga of the Vision of the
Universal Form
(1) Now, in this eleventh chapter, the story is having two moods of
literature. Here Partha will have a meeting with the Universal God.
(2) Here, the mood of wonder has come as a guest to dine at the home
of the mood of peace, and other moods of literature are also honoured
to share the dinner.
(3) Sirs, just as at the wedding of the bride and the bridegroom, the
other guests from the sides of both the bride and the bridegroom get
presents of cloths and ornaments, so in the same fashion, other
moods of literature are sitting honourably on the seats of the Marathi
language.
(4) But the mood of peace and wonder are so good that you can visually
take them by your palms of eyes, and they appear as if the Gods Hari
and Hara have come to embrace each other with love.
(5) Otherwise, we can say that just as both the Sun and the Moon meet
each other on the last day of the month, similarly there is merger of
two moods here.
(6) Just as the streams of Ganga and Yamuna meet, similarly this
chapter is like Prayaga for both the moods, and therefore the whole
world can become purified by bathing here.
