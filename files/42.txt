(223) Here, the brothers-in-law, the fathers-in-law, uncles and our brothers, sons and grand-sons -
are all our relations only.
(224) O God, please consider that these are all very intimately connected relatives of ours, and,
therefore even to talk anything against their well-being is to defile our speech.
एता न ह तुिम छािम नतोऽिप मधुसूदन|
अिप तैलो यरा य य हेतोः िक
ं नु महीक
ृ ते
O Madhusudana, even if these may kill me I do not wish to kill them even for the sake of the
kingdom of all the three worlds, what of this earth only? (35)
(225) Even if they do something quite wrong or even kill us, we should not even think of killing
them.
(226) I am not willing to commit such a wrong action, even if there is possibility of total unhindered
power over all the three worlds.
(227) Who will have respect in their minds for us, if we commit this action here? And O
Shrikrishna, will we be able to show you our face without shame?
िनह य धातरा ा नः का पीितः या जनादन|
पापमेवाशयेद मा ह वैतानातताियनः
O Krishna, how can we hope to be happy by slaying the sons of Dhritarashtra? By killing these
desperadoes, only sin will surely take resort in us. (36)
(228) If I kill these kinsmen, then I will be the home of sins and I will lose you with whom I have
become so intimate.
(229) When all the sins of killing our own family-members will attach themselves to us, then how
can we be lucky to see you?
(230) Just as the Cuckoo does not wait for a moment in a garden which is on fire;
(231) and just as the bird Chakora does not pay heed to a muddy pond and goes away by discarding
it;
(232) Similarly, O God, if the water of my merits is dried up, then you will not come to bless me
with your benevolence and kindness.
त मा नाहा वयं ह तुं धातरा ा वबा धवान्|
