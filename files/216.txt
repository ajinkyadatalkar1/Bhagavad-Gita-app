Chapter 8
The Yoga of Akshara Brahman
अजुन उवाच -
िक
ं त िकम या मं िक
ं कम पु षो म|
अिधभूतं च िक
ं पो मिधदैवं िकमु यते
Arjuna said, “O Purushottama, what is that Brahma (Absolute), what is Adhyatma (Spirit), and
what is Karma (Action)? What is called Adibhoota (Matter) and what is termed as Adhidaiva
(Divine Intelligence)? (1)
(1) Then Arjuna said, “Of course, I am attentive. Now please tell me what I have asked for.
(2) Please tell me. What is Brahman? What is Karma? And what is called Adhyatma?
(3) What is Adhibhoota? And Adhidaivata? Please tell me in a simple manner, so that I can
understand.
अिधय ः कथं कोऽत देहेऽि म मधुसूदन|
पयाणकाले च कथं ेयोऽिस िनयता मिभः
O Madhusudana, who is Adhiyajna here and how does he dwell in the body? And how are you to
be realized at the time of death by those of steadfast mind? (2)
(4) My Lord, how that Adhiyajna which you referred to, lives in this body? And who is he?
Somehow I cannot grasp this very well.
(5) Further, O Lord, please tell me how you are remembered at the time of death by the mind which
is fully under control, O the holder of Sharnga bow.”
(6) Saint Dnyaneshwar says - If a lucky man sleeps in a palace built of Chintamani-stones, even his
babbling will not be in vain.
(7) Similarly, before Arjuna completed his question, the Lord said, “Arjuna, please listen properly,
what you have asked.”
(8) Saint Dnyaneshwar says, “Arjuna was a calf of the cow called Kamadhenu and further he was in
the shadow of the divine wish-tree; so what wonder is there if fulfillment of his desire came
voluntarily to him?
