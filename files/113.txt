Shri Bhagwan said -
I taught this immortal yoga to Wiwaswan, the sun-God, then Wiwaswan told it to Manu (His son)
and Manu imparted it to Ikshwaku, his son. (1)
(16) Then the Lord said to the son of Pandu - "I told this yoga to Wiwaswan but that is a story of
very ancient days.
(17) Then that Wiwaswan, the Sun, taught this best state of yoga to Manu.
(18) Manu himself practised it and then taught it to Ikshwaku. Thus this original tradition spread
further.
एवं परंपरापा िममं राजषयो िवदुः|
स कालेनेह महता योगो न ः परंतप
O Arjuna who is a hexation to enemies, this yoga was known to the yogi kings who were sages
themselves, by the succession of teacher and the taught; but it has, by the lapse of long time,
disappeared from this earth (2).
(19) Thence this yoga was known by great kings who were sages, but in these present days, nobody
knows this yoga.
(20) As everybody is having the fever of passion in him and is heavily attached to his physical body,
this self-knowledge was forgotten.
(21) When awareness and importance of Atman is not firm, in our life there is greatest value given to
pleasures of senses and people are much attached to their belongings.
(22) For example what value of clothes is there in the town where all people are naked Jains, and
what value has Sun to a congenitally blind man?
(23) Or, who will like music where all are deaf? What do the foxes care for moonlight?
(24) Or, how will the crows ever know the Moon, when their eyes lose their vision as soon as the
Moon rises?
(25) Similarly how can those foolish persons who do not touch the boundary of the quality of
desirelessness, nor know the language of discrimination, know me, the God!
(26) One does not know how the enticement to pleasures has increased so much, but a long time has
elapsed in it, in the course of which this yoga has disappeared from this world.
