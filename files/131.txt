(185) Then he said - ‘O the crowned one. I will tell you how to attain knowledge. Please give your
attention to this.
श ावॉ ं लभते ानं त परः संयतेि दयः|
ानं ल वा परां शांितमिचरे णािधग छित
He who has control over his senses, is sincere and faithful in the practice of yoga, gains
knowledge and without any delay attains supreme peace. (39)
(186) He who, after tasting the joy in Atman, becomes bored by all other objects, and does not pay
any respect to his senses.
(187) He who is not enamoured with the demands of his mind, does not take anything from the
Prakriti, and who is happy with his faith–
(188) - Is the man whom knowledge comes searching for and in whom there is eternal abiding peace.
(189) That self-knowledge is established in the heart and the peace sprouts; after which, there is
evidence of the self-realization in its expanded state.
(190) Then wherever one looks, there is only peace and even by trying to find it, there is no
difference between “I and You”.
(191) Such is the unlimited vastness of knowledge. But enough of this description now.
अ ाश धान संशया मा िवन यित|
नायं लोकोऽि त न परो न सुखं संशया मनः
He who lacks knowledge, who is not having faith, and is possessed by deep doubt is lost to the
spiritual path. For the doubting soul there is neither fulfilment in this world nor in the other world,
and not even any happiness. (40)
(192) Please listen. If anybody has no interest in this knowledge, should we call his living really
worth the name? He is better dead.
(193) Just as a house which is empty, or as a body without life-force; that life which is without
knowledge is simply an illusion.
(194) Even a man may not be having knowledge, but if he may at least have some liking about it, then
there is some hope of his gaining it.
(195) But, let alone actual knowledge; if he has absolutely no eagerness in his mind to learn, then
you should know that he has fallen into the fire of doubt.
