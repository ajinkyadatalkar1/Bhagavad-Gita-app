(67) If luckily action is done rightly, knowledge can be gained;
otherwise the very action would be leading a man downwards.
(68) There are many disturbances while any action is being completed
according to standards. Then how can persons performing actions
have a chance to attain liberation?
(69) Therefore, this bondage of performance of action should be cut, all
actions should be given up and Sanyasa which is having no such
defects should be followed.
(70) The two things in which there is no fear of bad effect of action and
by which one attains self knowledge,
(71) Those two which are like Mantras invoking knowledge or like
fertile gardens giving the crop of knowledge; or like threads which
are capable of pulling the knowledge nearer to us;
(72) Are 'Sanyasa' and 'Tyaga'. When we accept these two, all relations
with the world are snapped. Therefore, it is better to ask the Lord to
explain the nature of Sanyasa and Tyaga. (Renunciation, and
abandoning everything).
(73, 74) Planning like this in his mind, when Arjuna asked the Lord
about the nature of these two, namely the renunciation and
abandoning, the Lord answered him, which is contained in this
eighteenth chapter.
(75) Thus in this Geeta, one chapter comes out of another chapter as a
natural offspring. Now please listen to what Arjuna asked.
(76) The son of Pandu listened with full attention, to what the Lord last
said and understood it.
