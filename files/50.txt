(24) Did you not know them earlier? Or had you not recognized all these kinsmen? Then why these
tantrums and extreme sorrow at this time?
(25) My dear, is this war a new thing in your life? This is a constant family feud among all of you.
(26) Then what new has happened today? And why has pityarisen in your mind, I do not quite
understand. However, O Arjuna, one thing is sure, you have done wrong.
(27) If you are ensnared in your attachment, it will result in the loss of the respectability which you
have earned so far, and this life as well as the spiritual life will be lost to you.
(28) The softness of heart should not be harboured by a real warrior and for a Kshatriya like you, it
is itself a great fall.
(29) In this way, that kind Lord was trying to teach, him in many ways, listening to which, see what
the son of Pandu said -
अजुन उवाच -
कथं भी ममहं सं ये दोणं च मधुसूदन|
इषुिभः पितयो यािम पूजाहाव रसूदन
Arjuna said, “O (Krishna) Madhusudana, how shall I fight Bheeshma and Drona with arrows in
this battle? O the destroyer of enemies! They are worthy of our worship!” (4)
(30) O God! There is no need to talk so much. Please look. Consider the type and the nature of this
war.
(31) Sir, this is not war, this is simply a sin. If we commit this sin we will be having great blame.
We are going to be the destroyers of our own special identity.
(32) Dear God, please consider. How can we kill our own parents when we know the good conduct
which consists in paying respect to them and keeping them fully happy and contented?
(33) My God, These saintly people should be saluted; they should be worshipped if possible! But
should we by our own speech, blame them instead of doing these right things?
(34) Similarly, these teachers of our family are worth being always worshipped by us. I have gained
lot of good things from Bheeshma and Drona.
(35) O God! How can we kill these people about whom we cannot think of animosity even in our
dream?
