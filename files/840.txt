daughter, taking whom Wasudeva went back to his jail, and here in
Nand's house, next morning the birth of the boy was hailed with grand
festival. Thus, the Lord Krishna is described here to have gone to Gokul,
in exchange of Maya.
(31) Chapter 10. Ovi - 288.
This Ovi refers to Pootana a demoniac woman who had poison in her
breasts, and who went to Gokul in the garb of a beautiful human
woman. She, by great guile, tried to breast-feed the child Krishna by her
poisonous milk, but child though he was, Krishna was knowing the evil
deception and by his divine power, squeezed all the poisonous milk
from her breast together with her life-element and he killed her.
(32) Chapter 10. Ovi - 289.
The Ovi refers to the lifting of the mountain named Govardhana, by
Krishna on the tip of his raised little finger and protecting the resident
of Gokula from the hail-storm created by Mahendra - the God of rain,
the ruler of heavens who was angry because Krishna had advised the
cow-herds of Gokul to stop worshipping Indra and worship the
mountain Govardhana as it was the supporter of their life.
(33) Chapter 10. Ovi - 290.
This verse refers to the defeat of the venomous Kalia Cobra in the
river Kalindi (Yamuna), who was a great menace to all beasts, birds and
human beings. Krishna controlled the Cobra and compelled him to leave
Yamuna and go into the sea. This gave great relief to the river because
its waters were again pure and to the residents of Gokul because the
danger of death was removed.
