(219) At that time your heart will be broken. Then why not fight with all your capacities? If you
defeat these, you will rule over this earth.
हतो वा पा यिस वग िज वा वा भो यसे महीम्|
त मादुि कौ तेय यु ाय क
ृ तिन यः
If you are killed in war, you will attain heaven, and if you gain victory, you will enjoy the
kingdom on the earth. Therefore, O son of Kunti, stand up with determination to fight. (37)
(220) If at all you will surrender your life while fighting here, you will gain heavenly happiness as a
matter of course.
(221) Therefore, O, the crowned Arjuna, do not hesitate in this matter. Stand up now, lifting your
bow and start to fight immediately.
(222) You see, while you will do your duty like this, even the existing sins will be washed. How are
you deluded about any sin in this war?
(223) Please tell me - Will one be drowned if one sits in a boat? Or does one stumble if one walks
by a well-trodden path? If at all one does not know how to walk steadily, perhaps one may
stumble.
(224) If poison is mixed with nectar while drinking, even nectar will cause death. Similarly, there is
sin or blemish if our own duty is performed with selfish desire.
(225) Therefore, O Partha, if you fight according to the natural duty of Kshatriyas, leaving selfish
desires away, you will not commit sin.
सुखदुःखे समे क
ृ वा लाभालाभौ जयाजयौ|
ततो यु ाय यु य व नैवं पापमवा यिस
Treating alike pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat, get ready for this battle. Then,
you will not thus incur sin. (38)
(226) You should not feel comfortable if some happy conditions are there, and you should not be
depressed if you suffer pain, and you should not consider profit or loss, in your mind.
(227) You should not anticipate whether there will be victory or you will meet death; which may
happen in future.
(228) While calmly performing our own duty which is appropriate for us, we should quietly sustain
whatever will come to our lot.
