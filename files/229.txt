water which is their body is dried-up by death, (their existence in the body is an illusion), they
remain in the Atman which is their real nature.
(139) I am always by their side in their life also, because they are united with me and, therefore,
there is no doubt that they come to me after their death.
(140) Then the body which is the form of “tree of hardships”, the oven of three types of calamities,
and which is a lump of food thrown to the ‘crow’ which is death.
(141) The body which gives milk of misery, increases the greatest fear and which is the capital
amount of all sorrow,
(142) The body which is the root cause of evil intellect, which is the fruit of plant of bad deeds and
which is the very image of delusion,
(143) The body which is the seat of family-life, which is the playground of various vices and which
is the readymade food of all diseases,
(144) The body which is the article of boiled rice already tasted by death, which is the place of
resort for ‘hope’ and which is the fertile watery-land where the crop of birth and death is
cultivated,
(145) & (146) The body which is full of confusion, made up of doubts and infested by the scorpions
of pain, the body which is the cave of a tiger, the companion of a prostitute and instrument of
enjoying the pleasure of sense-objects,
(147) The body which is like the sinister female ghost or the sip of the cold poison or the pretended
friendship of a way-layer,
(148)The body which is the embrace of a leper, or the softness of a deadly cobra or the rustic,
natural song of a hunter,
(149) The body which is like a welcome reception offered by an enemy, or respect paid by an evil
doer or is an ocean of all disasters,
(150) The body which is like a dream seen in a dream or a forest grown on the waters of mirage or a
sky moulded by the specks of dust of smoke.
(151) The body of such signs or qualities, is not required to be taken again by the devotees who have
reached the unlimited absolute Brahman and have eternally remained thus united with it.
