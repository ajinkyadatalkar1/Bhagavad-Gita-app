(653) He does not lose even a farthing out of the profit which he gets, but is ready to lose his life any
moment just for that much little thing.
(654) He is very miser about his possessions, but is very keen to loot others, just like a crane which
is swift to catch a fish.
(655) Just as a berry-tree which tears the cloth if we go near it, scratches our skin if we come into its
contact and the fruits of which or so sour that they bite our tongue,
(656) He gives great trouble to others, and does not care at all about the welfare of others, when
there is chance to get what he wants.
(657) He does not show any lenience or give concessions to others when he is doing his selfish
work, and he always avoids any type of emotion however noble it may be, if he does not like it.
(658) He is totally doltish and poisonous both inside and out like the poppy seed, which is thorny
outside and poisonous inside.
(659) O Dhananjaya, if such a man is successful in his action, and gets fruit which he desired, he
immediately makes a big pomp and show and teases other people.
(660) If his efforts meet failure, he becomes corroded by sorrow and starts blaming the world.
(661) When the doer is busy in such actions, he should be definitely known as Rajasic doer.
(662) Now I shall describe the doer of Tamas quality, who is as if a cultivated garden of evil
actions.
अयु ः पाक
ृ तः त धः शठो नै क
ृ ितकोऽलसः|
िवषादी दीघसूती च कता तामस उ यते
A man whose mind is not concentrated, who is uncultured, stolid, cunning, lazy, good for nothing,
victim of depression, having dilatory tactics, is a doer of Tamasic quality. (28)
