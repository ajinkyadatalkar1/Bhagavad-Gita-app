(860) That extraordinary excellence is the quality of brightness, the second virtue in his action; and
firmness with patience is the third quality in him.
(861) Know this quality of firmness, which makes a man not lose his mental balance and discretion
even though the sky may fall upon him.
(862) And just as lotus spreads its leaves on the surface of the water, however vast may be the
expanse of that water; and just as sky is always higher than anything which is raised to any height,
(863,864) Similarly, O Partha, the quality of penetrating into the intended project very astutely and
exactly, is called the quality of alertness, which is the fourth virtue and the fifth virtue is great
bravery in fighting.
(865) The sunflowers have their face always towards the Sun; similarly when the warrior is always
bravely facing the enemy,
(866) Not to show one's back in the battle to the enemy just as a woman who is pregnant avoids
sleeping with her husband,
(867) Is the fifth virtue in the Kshtriya's nature, which, O Arjuna, you should know, which is greater
than the four virtues told to you earlier, just as Devotional Path is the highest path in human
achievement of his whole life time.
(868) Just as a tree bends its branches when it bears fruits, or just as a lotus lake is freely
distributing its fragrance.
(869) Or just as anybody can take the joy of moonlight as much as he likes; so, the man gives in
charity to everybody as is desired;
(870) This is called unlimited generosity and the mind has this sixth gem of a virtue; and to nourish
and develop our own body; and to make all obey our orders.
(871) And to look after the subjects under our rule as if they are our own limbs and to enjoy
sovereign power through them,
(872) Is the quality by name of "sense of superiority", which is the reservoir of all strength. This is
the seventh gem of a virtue the man possesses.
(873) Thus, the action which has all the abovesaid seven qualities, just as the sky is beautifully
decorated by the Seven Sages constellation (Greater Bear) near the North Pole star;
(874) Know that this pure action which is like that, ornamented by wonderful seven virtues is the
natural duty belonging to Kshatriyas,
