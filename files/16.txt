rallies, Vari - a collective religious march towards Pandharpur, etc. a
vow of clean vegetarian diet, kindness, non-violence, denial of any
intoxicating drinks and tobacco, etc. and other observances like fasting
on Ekadashi day etc., which is called WARKARI SAMPRADAYA,
devoted to Vitthal, the God who is Shri Vishnu. This change-over from
Shaivism of Yogic nature to Vaishnawa cult of pure Devotion was the
most important achievement of Dnyandeva, which opened the gates of
liberation to simple pious people.
In the year 1296 A.D. with a sense of total desirelessness, and having
completed his mission of awakening the mass mind to the necessity of
leading a cultured and pious life, Saint Dnyanadeva decided to enter the
final trance which means taking the life-force through the body to the
highest region in the head, called the thousand-petalled Lotus of
nervous complexities, and for this an underground chamber was
prepared at Alandi (near Pune city in the Maharashtra State).
Dnyanadeva entered into this chamber and sat in the Lotus posture in
the final trance. That day and time of Samadhi was Kartik Vadya 13 of
Shaka 1218, on Thursday, in the noon. There, a Samadhi temple was
built afterwards which has, through the seven Centuries become a very
great place of pilgrimage in Maharashtra.
Shortly after this taking of final Samadhi in the living body, by
Dnyanadeva, his younger brother Sopana, elder brother and Guru
Nivrutti and younger sister Mukta, ended their journey on this planet
earth, by the same process of willfully leaving the body by Yoga.
Sopana's Samadhi place is at Saswad, that of Mukta is at Mangaon near
Edalabad, and the Samadhi Temple of Nivrutti is at Triambakeshwar
near Nasik.
