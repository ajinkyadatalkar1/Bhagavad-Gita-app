(268) Sanjaya said to Dhritarashtra. “O, king, this was what Arjuna said at that time on the
battlefield. Now listen.
(269) Then Arjuna was much dejected and was so moved by compassion that he could not control
himself and jumped down from the chariot.
(270) He looked like the king who becomes totally beaten when usurped from his throne, or like the
Sun eclipsed by Rahu.
(271) Or, he looked like a monk caught in the overpowering desire to use occult faculties who
becomes confused and pitiable by the lust for carnal pleasures.
(272) Thus appeared Arjuna, completely squeezed by depression, sitting down on the ground beside
his chariot.
(273) Then he threw down his bow and arrow, and tears started from his eyes being shed profusely.
Listen, O king! It so happened!" Thus said Sanjaya.
(274) Now, seeing Arjuna overwhelmed by sorrow, what will the Lord of Vaikuntha teach him in the
spiritual life -
(275) will be a very interesting narration to listen to, further on!” says Dnyandeva, the servant
(disciple) of Saint Nivrutti.

Thus, in the Upanishads sung by the Lord, in the science of knowledge of Brahman, in the
scripture of Yoga, and in the dialogue between Shrikrishna and Arjuna, the first Adhyaya (chapter)
entitled “The Yoga of Dejection of Arjuna," comes to an end. (1)
