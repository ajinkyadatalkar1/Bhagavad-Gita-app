Then how can there be the duality in you as the person and his
virtues? Further, is it right to do this bifurcation? Is it not proper to
keep the pearl as it is than first to break it and then to join its pieces
together?
(21) Similarly it is not right to praise you, imagining you to be my
mother and father, because in it, there is the fault of conceiving the
attachment of the child in you.
(22) Sir, if I imagine that I am your servant you become automatically
my master. Is it right to praise you with such appendages like these?
(23) If I say that you are Atman, then it implies that you are outside me,
whom I am describing.
(24) Therefore, I do not find it easy in any way to praise you in the
worldly terms. O God! Nothing but silence can be an ornament that
can be tolerated by you.
(25) To praise you is not to speak anything, to worship you is not to do
anything and to be near you is not to remain a separate being but to
merge into you.
(26) So, please somehow tolerate whatever I do due to my extreme love
for you. That is the only request to you who are my kind mother.
(27) Now, please give the hallmark of your blissful approval on the
explanation of the meaning of Geeta which I am giving further on, in
such a way that the listeners will be pleased.
(28) Upon this, Shri Nivrutti said- "Enough! Enough! Is it necessary to
say these things again and again? How many times is Parees stone
required to be rubbed on the piece of iron?"
