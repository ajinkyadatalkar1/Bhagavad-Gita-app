arisen;
(560) He who, after being endowed with self-knowledge, is feeling that this world is false like a
dream.
(561) Or, just as when one actually holds in his hand a rosary, the illusion and fear of its being a
serpent become nullified; so, he is not caught in the mundane life when he gains knowledge about
me.
(562) He who knows that the ornament is really gold only, says that the shape of the ornament is
false. Similarly he who has known me and therefore discarded duality;
(563) And then he who says-"I am all– pervading, alone without a second; self-evident, complete in
my existence, life and joy," and not harbouring any thought about his separateness, knows my
reality as Atman-
(564) Has known all; but this statement is also short of truth; because in him there is no ‘‘duality’’
which is the object of description.
(565) Dear Arjuna, therefore only such a person can be my true devotee; just as only sky can
embrace the sky.
(566) The sea of milk only can give a dinner to the sea of milk and only nectar can be mixed with
nectar if its purity is to be maintained.
(567) Just as pure gold mixed with pure gold becomes pure gold only, so, by becoming me only, my
true devotion is possible.
(568) Just see! If the Ganges will not be ready to be like the sea then how can it meet that sea?
(569) So, he who worships me just like the wave which is totally inseparable from the water;
(570) Has such an intimate relationship with me that can be compared with the relationship between
the Sun and his light.

O the sinless one! O Bharat! This most esoteric teaching has thus been imparted by me. By
grasping it intellectually a man becomes endowed with wisdom and becomes one who has
accomplished his duties in life. (20)

chapter, the essence of all the scriptures is propounded, which gives fragrance of the Upanishads
