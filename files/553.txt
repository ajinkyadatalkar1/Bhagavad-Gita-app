and outside water.
(349) If a crystal is kept on a spot of red-lead, the crystal seems to be red, to ordinary persons, but it
is not so.
(350) Similarly though my quality of having no beginning and not being a doer, is really not affected,
I am thought to be the actor, the doer and the receiver of the results of action; which is a delusion.
(351) In short, Atman, who is pure becomes joint with Prakriti and himself assumes the qualities of
Prakriti to be his own.
(352) Then, by thinking that the mind and other sense organs like ears, etc., making a total of six, are
his own, he starts functioning in this world.
(353) This is like a monk becoming himself his own family in the dream, and running here and there
to feed it.
(354) Similarly Atman forgets himself, and thinks that he belongs to the Prakriti and is similar to her;
and worships her.
(355) Then he rides up on the chariot of mind, enters into the hole of the ear and gets himself
involved in the forest of words.
(356) The same Atman by holding the robe of Prakriti turns to the skin and enters the heavy forest of
the objects of physical contacts.
(357) Further, he enters in the eyes and roams about at random on the mountain of the objects of
shapes and forms.
(358) He enters the tongue and gets himself bound in the narrow valley of taste.
(359) And when this Atman being proud of his body enters into the nose, he walks in the meandering
paths of the forest of various smells.
(360) In this way, this Jeeva who is proudly attached to his body, embraces the mind tightly and
through it enjoys the various groups of sense objects like sound, sight, smell, etc.
शरीरं यदवा नोित य चा यु कामती रः|
गृही वैतािन संयाित वायुग धािनवाशयात्
Even as the wind takes away the scents from the flowers, which are their seats, so the Jeevatma,
who adopts this body and holds it in his power, taking these with him, leaves the body behind and
goes beyond (to another body). (8)
