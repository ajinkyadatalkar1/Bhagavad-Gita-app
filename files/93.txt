follow this. Then all your wishes will be fulfilled.
(89) You need not undertake any vows or observe rules which may be painful to your bodies, nor go
far away to places of pilgrimage.
(90) You will, by misunderstanding, do yoga, or selfish penances, repetition of words, or
worshipping of geometrical figures (for propitiating gods) - which you should not do.
(91) You should not worship different Gods; you should do nothing of the kind. You should practise
your own duty in the society according to your status and by this, you should perform the easiest
sacrifice.
(92) You should follow this duty without motive, just as a faithful woman serves her husband.
(93) So, the sacrifice implied in doing your duty is the only sacrifice which you should perform, - so
said the king of Satyaloka (the highest spiritual world).
(94) You see; if you follow your own duty as a religion, it will serve you as the divine cow which
fulfills your wish; and then, O, people! This religion will never for sake you.
देवान् भावयतानेन ते देवा भावय तु वः|
पर परं भावय तः शेयः परमवा यथ
Propitiate the gods through this (sacrifice) and they may be then gracious to you. Thus, by helping
each other respectfully you may attain the final goal. (11)
(95) Thus all the deities will be satisfied fully and then will give you your desired things.
(96) When all the deities are thus worshipped by your observing your own religion, they will
arrange to help you fulfil your life’s mission.
(97) You will worship the gods and the gods will be pleased with you. Thus, there will be mutual
love.
(98) Then whatever you intend to do, will be automatically successful and the things desired by your
mind will also be attained by you.
(99) Your speech will prove to be true, you will be the givers of orders, and all the prosperity of
very high rank will be eager to be at your service.
(100) It will be like the rich nature, with all the beauty of fruits etc; standing at the door of the king
of all seasons viz. the spring -!
