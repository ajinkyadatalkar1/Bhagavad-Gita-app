(27) In the same manner I have again and again bowed down to the
same preceptor who fulfils all the things my heart yearns for.
(28) Now please listen to the comprehensive and exhaustive story,
which is the birthplace of the pleasures of Arts, or a novel garden full
of trees of ‘discrimination’.
(29) Or, it may be called the origin of all happiness, which is the great
reservoir of all doctrines, or, for that matter, it is the ocean of the
nectar of nine moods of literature, which is always full.
(30) Or this story is the manifest home of the highest fortune, or the
root of all knowledge and the place of residence for all the branches
of sciences, without exception.
(31) In other words, it is the maternal home of all religions, the delicate
heart of gentle sages, and the storehouse of the jewels of great
beauty, of goddess Sharada.
(32) No, No! Bharati, the very goddess of speech, has become manifest
in the form of this story in all the three worlds, by giving all
expressions to the supra-intelligence of the sage Vyasa.
(33) Therefore, this story is the queen of all poetry, a storehouse of the
greatness of books and the giver of shape and clarity to all the
esthetic moods of literature.
(34) So also, please listen to something more about its greatness. From
this story, the glory of words got the scientific base and the
delicateness of the subtle spiritual understanding has doubled itself.
(35) Here, (in this story of Mahabharat) cleverness has become
endowed with wisdom, the Brahman has got sweet taste, and the
good fortune of happiness has received nourishment.
