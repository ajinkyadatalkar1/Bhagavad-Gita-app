ordinary people while walking on a road, are told to avoid going into the house of a very lowly
man. You should remember them well.
य ु क
ृ नवदेकि म काय स महैतुकम्|
अत वाथवद पं च त ामसमुदा तम्
And Tamasic knowledge is that where a man becomes attached to only one work as if that is all
that life is, and his attachment is also purposeless and useless; further that knowledge is devoid of any
wisdom or meaning and it is also shallow and of very temporary nature (22)
(549) O the crowned one, that knowledge which does not wear the proper clothing of the scriptures
is naked and, therefore, Veda, like a shy damsel turns her face away from it, because the good
conduct is her son.
(550) And since the scriptures have banished this knowledge, other sciences also, in an effort to
avoid taking its name have turned it away in the far mountains of Mlenchha-Dharma, (non-vedic
religions.)
(551) Such knowledge which is possessed by the ghost of the evil quality of Tamas, roams about
everywhere without any aim.
(552) This is such a knowledge which knows no restrictions in the matter of physically being
promiscuous, or eating any food just like a stray dog in a village, who
(553) eats not only that which is bigger than its mouth or which is so hot that it burns his mouth, but
eats anything without a thought.
(554) Or like a rat which per chance picks up a piece of gold and scurries down to its hole, does not
wait to check if the gold is pure or impure; or a man who eats meat does not bother if the animal
had a fair skin or a dark one;
(555) Or like the forest fire which does not see whom or which it is burning down, or a fly sits on a
body not bothering if it is a dead body or a living person.
(556) Or like a crow which has no consideration whether what it picks up by beak is a good food, or
a vomit, or a stale food having obnoxious rotten smell;
(557) Similarly this Tamasic knowledge does not make any distinction in the action, to avoid the bad
and choose the good one.
(558) It thinks that whatever is seen by the eyes is meant for our enjoyment and out of these the
woman should be used to satisfy sex and material should be utilized as consumable goods.
