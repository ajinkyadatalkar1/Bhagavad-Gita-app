मानापमानयो तु य तु यो िमता रप योः|
सवारंभप र यागी गुणातीतः स उ यते
He who is equal in reacting to respect or insult, and equal to friends and men of opposite party;
and he who abandons all pre-meditated actions is called a man beyond qualities. (25)
(362) Though this man is worshipped as a god or harassed by taking him to be thief, or made a king
with elephants and cattle;
(363) Though friends gather near him or enemies attack him, he, just as the light of the Sun has no
difference between the night or day- and
(364) Just as the sky is not touched by any of the six seasons, his mind does not know anything
abnormal in these different situations.
(365) There is yet another sign. Though he functions in various activities, he does not appear to do
those intentionally.
(366) He uproots all bondages of Karma. He destroys the very base of outgoing attitude. He is like
fire in which the fruits of action are burnt.
(367) As nothing about the happiness in this world or the higher world is born in his mind, he simply
meets everything that comes along, in a detached manner.
(368) He does not celebrate happiness nor laments any pain because just like a stone, his mind has
given up all planning and doubting.
(369) But enough with this prolonged explanation. He is the real man beyond qualities whose
behaviour is evidently like this.
(370) The master Shrikrishna said - "Now listen to the way by which a man is able to go beyond the
Sattwa etc., qualities.
मां च योऽ यिभचारे ण भि योगेन सेवते|
स गुणा समती यैतान् ब भूयाय क पते
And he who serves me with the yoga of devotion with one -pointed concentration goes beyond
these Qualities and becomes worthy to be one with Brahman. (26)
(371) And he can burn these qualities, who by undivided attention serves me with the yoga of
devotion.
(372) In this context, it is necessary to define who I am and what the undivided devotion is.
