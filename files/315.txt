(292) How much should I tell you all this? You have either seen or heard everything. In short, know
that this is my form among the Yadavas.
(293) And among you Pandavas of the Soma lineage, know that I am Arjuna, yourself. Therefore,
there is no dent in the loving relationship between us.
(294) Being a Sanyasi in appearence, you took away my sister, but I was not disturbed. In this way,
we both are one in reality.
(295) The king of Yadavas said, "I am Vyasa, the divine sage, and I am the teacher called Ushana,
who is very courageous among the great seers.
द डो दमयतामि म नीितरि म िजगीषताम्|
मौनं चैवाि म गु ानां ानं ानवतामहम्
In the rulers I am the subduing power. I am the righteousness in those who wish to be victorious. I
am the silence of those who guard secrets and wisdom of the wise. (38)
(296) Please understand that I am the punishment which the ruling authorities give and everybody
from Brahma to the ant is subject to it.
(297) I am the science of morals in the case of those who decide what is essential and what is
nonessential, and who take the side of the understanding of religion, and the science of good
behaviour in all the moral codes.
(298) I am the silence, which is the best way to keep secret and therefore even god the creator
cannot know what is in the mind of those who are silent.
(299) My dear, please see that I am the wisdom of the men of wisdom. But let us stop here. There is
no end to my manifestations.
य चािप सवभूतानां बीजं तदहमजुन|
न तदि त िवना यत् या मया भूतं चराचरम्
ना तोऽि त मम िद यानां िवभूतीनां परंतप|
एष तू ेशतः पो ो िवभूतेिव तरो मया
O Arjuna, whatever is the seed of all beings I am that. There is not a single living being or
inanimate thing which is not born out of me. (39)
O the one who gives trouble to the enemies, there is no end to my manifestations. This is just a
short list of my manifestations, given to you as only an indication (40)
