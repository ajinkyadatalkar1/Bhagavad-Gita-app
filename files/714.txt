(331) These organs are the third cause or means for "action" here, which, O the prince, you should
understand properly.
(332) And just as water flowing through the streams going in various directions is only one water
when it meets sea;
(333) Similarly, energy of action which is one only in the wind, becomes variously expressed when
it falls into various respective places.
(334) When it enters the speech, it speaks and when it enters the hand, it does the work of giving and
taking.
(335) And in the feet it becomes the movement of walking and when it enters the lower abdomen it
functions as the work of ejecting and throwing out excreta, urine, etc.
(336) From the navel upto the heart it functions as Prana or breath and so it is called as the vital
breath in the body.
(337) When it reaches the higher parts of the body, it is called "Udana";
(338) While in the lower orifices it works as Apana and when it permeates the whole body it is
called Vyana.
(339) When it fills the whole body by the juices of digested food, it is also functioning in all the
joints,
(340) And in this field of activity within the whole body, O the crowned one, it is called as
'Samaana'.
(341) When yawning, sneezing, belching etc. symptoms appear, the same wind which causes these is
called either Naga, Koorma and Krukara, etc.
(342) O the great warrior! Though these activities are of one Vayu, (wind, gas) only, they get various
names according to the place where they are.
(343) This power or energy of the wind which is of various kinds, is the fourth cause of action here.
(344) Now about the Divine plan. You see, the Sharad season which is a pleasant one is also
endowed with Moon which becomes full on the full Moon night, thus the beauty of the season is
enhanced.
(345) Secondly, a good pleasure-garden is better in the spring season, and if a company of the loved
one is there, it is still better and best is the availability of all kinds of pleasures there.
