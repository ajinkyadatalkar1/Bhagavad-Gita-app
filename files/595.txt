(268) Only he who harbours these six vices, O Dhananjaya, is bound by this evil property, not by
anybody else.
(269) O Pandava, you are, however, born with the divine qualities which are just now described.
(270) Therefore, O Partha, you should own these divine virtues and enjoy the bliss of Freedom, the
Absolute one-ness.
ौ भूतसग लोक
े ऽि म दैव आसुर एव च|
दैवो िव तरशः पो ः आसुरं पाथ मे शृणु
O Partha, there are two streams of creation in this world, one is divine and the other is of
demons. The divine is described in details. Now, please listen from me the demonic division of
creation. (6)
(271) There are, right from the beginning, the two streams of people either with divine qualities or
bad qualities, continuously flowing in this world.
(272) This division is like the activities of creatures of the night going on at night and the activities
of human and other beings going on smoothly in the daytime.
(273) O the crowned one! Like this, both the divine and the demonic divisions of people function
according to their nature in this world.
(274) Out of these two, I have earlier described properly the divine quality in the chapter devoted to
the path of knowledge, etc.
(275) Now we will tell about the demonic property. Please listen to it carefully.
(276) There is no sound without any instrument to produce it; and without a flower, honey cannot be
had.
(277) Similarly, this evil nature cannot be manifest until it gets some 'body' to reside in it.
(278) But when it gets some such body, then it occupies it and fills it like fire occupying any wood
and burning it.
(279) Then, just as the shape of the juice in the sugar-cane is equal to the shape of that cane, so, the
evil property takes the shape of the body in which it thrives.
(280) O Dhananjaya, now we will describe the nature of those beings in whom the vices of the evil
are fully developed.
